</div>

<p>The after port anchor had come inboard
before I stepped over the rail of the Gullwing,
and leaped to the deck. The starboard and port
bowers were both catted and fished and the
stay-fore-sail had filled to pay off her head.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing directly on shore; the
current ran parallel with the land; there was no
choice of direction in getting the big four-master
under weigh, and she was headed into the stream.</p>

<p>A clarion voice shouted from the poop:</p>

<p>&#8220;Haul main-tack!</p>

<p>&#8220;Come aft with that sheet!</p>

<p>&#8220;Set jib and spanker! Look alive there!</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Gates! see if you can&#8217;t get some action
out of your watch!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir!&#8221; from the mate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helm a-lee! hard a-lee!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>&#8220;Hard a-lee she is!&#8221; growled the helmsman,
a great, hairy, two-fisted salt, with an enormous
quid of tobacco in one cheek, a cast in his eye,
and his blue shirt so wide open at the throat
that we could catch a glimpse of a dashing looking
mermaid, in blue and red, upon his chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Set fore-sail! Be alive, there, Mr. Barney.
Those men of yours act as stiff as Paddy&#8217;s
father&mdash;and him nine days dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>The stamping of the men on the deck as
they hauled on the ropes, a confusion of cries
from those in the tops, the squeal of the cables
running over the drum, the coughing of the
donkey-engine amidships by which the huge
anchors had been started from the bottom of
Valpariso roadstead, and the general bustle and
running about, kept Thankful Polk&mdash;who had
followed me aboard the big, four-stick schooner&mdash;and
I right there by the rail, where we would
be out of the way. Thankful gave me a sly
glance, as he whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ve caught a Tartar in Cap&#8217;n
Joe Bowditch&mdash;what?&#8221;</p>

<p>But I had noted the lines about the skipper&#8217;s
mouth and the wrinkles at the corners of his
quick, gray eyes. Those lines and wrinkles had
not been graved in the old sea-captain&#8217;s face by
any long-standing grouch. Captain Bowditch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
was a man who liked his joke; and even his
voice as he bawled orders from the quarter had
a tang of good-nature to it that was not to be
mistaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ll get along all right with him,
if we play the game straight,&#8221; I observed to my
chum, and turned then to wave my cap to Cap&#8217;n
Hi Rogers, of the whaling bark Scarboro, who
was now being rowed back to his own ship
after leaving us to the tender mercies of Cap&#8217;n
Bowditch.</p>

<p>&#8220;By hickey!&#8221; exclaimed the boy from Georgia,
glancing now along the deck, &#8220;ain&#8217;t she a
monster? Looks a mile from the wheel to the
break of the fo&#8217;castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the largest sailing vessel I had ever
been aboard of myself. The Scarboro was a
good sized bark, but as we crossed her stern
we could look down upon the whaler&#8217;s deck and
wave our hats to the friendly crew that had
been so kind to us. Only a single scowling face
was raised to ours as the Gullwing swept on, a
creamy wave breaking either side of her sharp
bow. This face belonged to my cousin, Paul
Downes, who scowled at me and shook his fist.
But I merely smiled back at him. I thought
that&mdash;at length&mdash;I could afford to laugh at my
cousin&#8217;s threats. I was bound straight for home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
aboard the Gullwing; he had eighteen months,
or more, to serve aboard the whaling bark.</p>

<p>Seeing that both the captain and the mates
were too busy just then to bother with us,
Thank and I strolled forward. It was a long,
long deck&mdash;and the boards were as white as
stone and water could make them. There was
some litter about just now, of course; but from
the look of the whole ship I made up my mind
right then and there that if Captain Bowditch
was a martinet in anything, it was in the line of
neatness and order. The slush tub beside the
galley door was freshly painted and had a tight
cover; there was no open swill bucket to gather
flies; the cook&#8217;s wiping towels had been boiled
out and were now hung upon a patent drying
rack fastened to the house, and were as white
and clean as the wash of a New England housewife.
Every bit of brightwork shone and where
paint was needed it had been newly put on with
no niggard hand. As the sails were broke out
and spread to catch the light wind, many of
them were white-new, while those that were
patched had been overboard for a good sousing
before being bent on again. Oh, the Gullwing
was a smart ship, with a smart skipper, and a
smart crew; one could appraise these facts with
half an eye.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>&#8220;Makes you think you ought to have wiped
your feet on the mat before stepping in, eh?&#8221;
chuckled Thank. &#8220;I bet we got to a place at
last, Sharp, where we&#8217;re bound to work. That
old feller with the whiskers up there could spot
a fly-speck on the flying jib-boom. I wonder
he don&#8217;t have brass cuspidors setting &#8217;round for
the deck-watch!&#8221;</p>

<p>Compared with the frowzy old vessels, captained
and manned by foreigners, that make
American ports, this American ship, American
skippered, and American manned, was a lady&#8217;s
parlor. &#8220;She&#8217;s a beauty,&#8221; I said. &#8220;We may
work for our pay&mdash;whatever it is to be&mdash;but
thank&#8217;s be &#8217;tis no sealing craft. The stench of
the old Gypsey Girl will never be out of my
nostrils.&#8221;</p>

<p>We stood about for a few minutes longer,
trying to keep out of the way of the busy crew;
but one husky, red faced fellow came sliding
down the backstays and landed square on
Thank&#8217;s head and shoulders, pitching him to the
deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out o&#8217; the way, you two young sawneys!&#8221;
growled this fellow. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know enough
to keep out from under foot?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thank had picked himself up quickly and
turned with his usual good-natured grin. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
was hard for anybody to pick a quarrel with
Thankful Polk.</p>

<p>&#8220;My law-dee, Mister&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Is
that the way you us&#8217;ally come from aloft?
Lucky I was right here to cushion ye, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>The red faced fellow, without a word, swung
at him with his hard fist doubled. I was a
pretty sturdy fellow myself, with more weight
than my chum, and I saw no reason for letting
him receive that blow when interference was so
easy. I stepped in and the bully crashed
against my shoulder, his blow never reaching
Thank. Nor did he hurt me, either. His collision
with my shoulder threw him off his
balance and he sprawled upon the deck, striking
his head hard. He rolled over and blinked up
at me for half a minute, too stunned to realize
what had happened to him.</p>

<p>The encounter was seen by half a dozen of the
men, but none of the officers spied us. The
spectators laughed as though they hugely enjoyed
the discomfiture of the bully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sarves ye right, Bob Promise,&#8221; muttered
one of the A. B.s; &#8220;I bet ye got more than ye
bargained for in that youngster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Caught a Tartar, eh, Bob?&#8221; scoffed another
man.</p>

<p>The fellow on the deck &#8220;came to&#8221; then, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
sprang up with every apparent intention of
attacking me. I had shielded my chum, but
it was plain that I had made an enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach ye, ye young swab!&#8221; Bob ejaculated,
and started for me.</p>

<p>But the others interfered. Several hustled the
bully back.</p>

<p>&#8220;None o&#8217; that, Bob Promise!&#8221; exclaimed the
first speaker. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have the old man down
here in a second.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll break that feller&#8217;s neck!&#8221; cried Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno whether ye will or not&mdash;in a stand
up fight,&#8221; drawled another of his shipmates.
&#8220;He looks like he could take care of himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had involuntarily fallen into an attitude of
self-defense. That is where I had the advantage
of Thank; I knew something about boxing,
and although the bully was heavier and
older than I, it was pretty certain that he had no
science. At any rate I wasn&#8217;t going to let him
think I was afraid of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wait!&#8221; growled Bob Promise. &#8220;You
stand up to me in the watch below, and I&#8217;ll eat
you alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had an idea that if he did I should disagree
with his stomach badly; but I did not say this.
I don&#8217;t think I am naturally a quarrelsome fellow,
if I am impulsive. Nor did I wish to get in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
bad with the captain and officers of the ship by
being mixed up in a fight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw!&#8221; I said, mildly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
to fight you, Mister. Thank didn&#8217;t intentionally
get in your way, and I didn&#8217;t mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You struck me, you white livered&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; I denied. &#8220;You ran against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you give me no back talk,&#8221; snarled
the fellow, but looking out watchfully for the
officers now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be mad,&#8221; I said, with a smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry if I hurt you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I guess that wasn&#8217;t a wise thing to say, although
I did not mean to heap fuel on the flames
of his wrath. He gave me a black look as he
turned away, muttering:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till I git you a-tween decks, my lad.
I&#8217;ll do for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thank and I looked at each other, and I guess
my countenance expressed all the chagrin I
felt, for my chum did not smile, as usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;You butted in for me, Sharp,&#8221; he said,
gloomily, &#8220;and now that big bruiser will beat
you up, as sure as shooting.&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>In Which I Relate My History and Stand Up to a
Bully</i></p>
</div>

<p>A fine introduction to my readers! That is
the way I look at it. It does seem to me, looking
back upon the last few years of my life, that
my impetuosity has forever been getting me into
unpleasant predicaments. Perhaps if I wasn&#8217;t
such a husky fellow for my age, and had not
learned to use my fists to defend myself, I
should not have &#8220;butted in,&#8221; as Thankful Polk
said, and so laid myself open to a beating at
the hands of Bob Promise, the bully of the Gullwing&#8217;s
fo&#8217;castle.</p>

<p>A quarrel with my cousin, Paul Downes, on a
certain September evening more than a year and
a half before, had resulted in a serious change in
my life and in a series of adventures which no
sensible fellow could ever have desired. For all
those months I had been separated from my
home, and from my mother who was a widow
and needed me, and at this particular time when
I had come aboard the Gullwing, my principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
wish and hope was to get back to my home, and
that as quickly as possible. That the reader
may better understand my situation I must
briefly recount my history up to this hour.</p>

<p>Something more than fifteen years previous
my father, Dr. Webb, of Bolderhead, Massachusetts,
while fishing from a dory off shore
was lost overboard and his body was never recovered.
This tragedy occurred three weeks
after the death of my maternal grandfather, Mr.
Darringford, who had objected to my mother&#8217;s
marriage to Dr. Webb, and who had left his
large estate in trust for my mother and myself,
but so tied up that we could never benefit by a
penny of it unless we separated from Dr. Webb,
or in case of my father&#8217;s death. Dr. Webb had
never been a money-making man&mdash;not even a
successful man as the world looks upon success&mdash;and
he was in financial difficulties at the time
of his fatal fishing trip.</p>

<p>Considering these circumstances, ill-natured
gossip said that Dr. Webb had committed suicide.
I was but two years old at the time and before
I had grown to the years of understanding, this
story had been smothered by time; I never
should have heard the story I believe had it not
been for my cousin, Paul Downes.</p>

<p>Mr. Chester Downes had married my mother&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
older sister, and that match had pleased Mr.
Darringford little better than the marriage of
his younger daughter. But Aunt Alice had died
previous to grandfather&#8217;s own decease, so Mr.
Downes and Paul had received but a very small
part of the Darringford estate. I know now
that Chester Downes had attached himself like
a leech to my weak and easily influenced mother,
and had it not been for Lawyer Hounsditch,
who was co-trustee with her, my uncle would
long since have completely controlled my own
and my mother&#8217;s property.</p>

<p>Chester Downes and his son, who was only a
few mouths older than myself, had done their
best to alienate my mother from me as I grew
older; but the quarrel between Paul and myself,
mentioned above, had brought matters to a
crisis, and I believed that I had gotten the
Downeses out of the house for good and all.
Fearing that Paul would try to &#8220;get square&#8221;
with me by harming my sloop, the Wavecrest,
I slept aboard that craft to guard her. At the
beginning of the September gale Paul sneaked
out of the sloop in the night, nailed me into the
cabin, and cut her moorings. I was blown out
to sea and was rescued by the whaling bark,
Scarboro, just beginning a three-years&#8217; voyage
to the South Seas.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>I was enabled to send home letters by a mail-boat,
but was forced to remain with the Scarboro
until she reached Buenos Ayres. The
story of an old boatsteerer, Tom Anderly by
name, had revived in my mind the mystery of
my poor father&#8217;s disappearance. Tom had been
one of the crew of a coasting schooner which had
rescued a man swimming in the sea on a foggy
day off Bolderhead Neck, at the time&mdash;as near
as I could figure&mdash;when my father was reported
drowned. This man had called himself Carver
and had left the coasting vessel at New York
after having borrowed two dollars from Tom.
Years afterward a letter had reached Tom from
this Carver, enclosing the borrowed money, and
postmarked Santiago, Chile. The details of
the boatsteerer&#8217;s story made me believe that the
man Carver was Dr. Webb, who had deserted
my mother and myself for the obvious reason
that, as long as he remained with us, we could
not benefit from grandfather&#8217;s estate.</p>

<p>While ashore at Buenos Ayres I was accosted
by a queer old Yankee named Adoniram Tugg,
master and owner of the schooner Sea Spell,
but whose principal business was the netting of
wild animals for animal dealers. He called me
&#8220;Professor Vose,&#8221; not having seen my face, and
explained that my voice and build were exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
like a partner of his whom he knew by that name.
The character of this Professor Vose, as described
by Captain Tugg, as well as other details,
led me to believe that he was the same man
whom the boatsteerer aboard the Scarboro had
known as Jim Carver, and the possibility of the
man being my father took hold of my imagination
so strongly that I shipped on the Sea
Spell for Tugg&#8217;s headquarters, located some miles
up a river emptying into the Straits of Magellan.</p>

<p>But when we reached the animal catcher&#8217;s
headquarters we found the shacks and cages
destroyed and it was Tugg&#8217;s belief that his
partner&mdash;the mysterious man I had come so
far to see&mdash;had been killed by the natives.
Making my way to Punta Arenas, to take a
steamship for home, feeling that my impulsiveness
had delayed my return to my mother unnecessarily,
I fell in again with the Scarboro.</p>

<p>To my surprise I found aboard of her, under
the name of &#8220;Bodfish,&#8221; my cousin, Paul Downes.
Fearing punishment for cutting my sloop adrift,
when his crime became known, Paul had run
away from home and had worked his way as
far as Buenos Ayres on a Bayne Line Steamship.
There Captain Rogers of the whaling bark had
found him in a crimp&#8217;s place and had bailed him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
out and taken him aboard the Scarboro. Paul
didn&#8217;t like his job, and demanded that I pay his
fare home on the steamship, but I believed
that a few months&#8217; experience with the whalers
would do my cousin no harm, and should have
refused his demand even had I had money
enough for both our fares. The details of these
adventures are related in full in the first volume
of this series, entitled, &#8220;Swept Out to Sea; or,
Clint Webb Among the Whalers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Because I refused to aid Paul he threatened
again to &#8220;get square,&#8221; and he certainly made
good his threat. I was to remain but two
nights at Punta Arenas and had already paid
my passage as far as Buenos Ayres on the
Dundee Castle; but Paul got in with some men
from the sealing steamer, Gypsey Girl, and they
shanghaied me aboard, together with a lad from
Georgia, Thankful Polk by name, who had tried
to help me. Our adventures with the sealers,
and our finding of the whaleship Firebrand
frozen in the ice and deserted by her crew after
her cargo of oil was complete, is related in number
two of the series, entitled, &#8220;The Frozen
Ship; or, Clint Webb Among the Sealers.&#8221;</p>

<p>During those adventures I learned that
Adoniram Tugg&#8217;s partner, Professor Vose, escaped
death at the hands of the Patagonians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
had joined forces with the animal catcher again,
and in the Sea Spell they likewise had sought and
found the frozen ship and her valuable cargo.
Professor Vose boarded the abandoned ship
and remained by her when the Sea Spell lost
most of her spars and top-hamper and Tugg was
obliged to beat into port to be refitted. Meanwhile,
from the deck of the Gypsey Girl, I saw
the vast field of ice and bergs in which the Firebrand
was frozen break up in a gale; was horrified
by the overwhelming of the frozen ship, and
had the evidence of my own eyes that, whether
the mysterious man in whom I was so greatly
interested was merely Vose, Jim Carver, or my
own father, he had sunk with the Firebrand
under the avalanche of ice.</p>

<p>Later the captain of the Gypsey Girl, a Russ
named Sergius, and Thankful Polk and I were
lost from the sealing steamer and are picked up
by the Scarboro which was on her way to Valpariso
to refit after the gales she had suffered
on the South Pacific whaling grounds. Captain
Rogers, knowing my exceeding anxiety to return
home, got a chance for Thank and I to work
our passage on the Gullwing, which was just
setting sail from Valpariso as the Scarboro
arrived at that port.</p>

<p>And here we were on the deck of the handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
schooner, homeward bound; but before I
had been here half an hour, it seemed, my ill-luck
had followed me. I was enmeshed in a
quarrel with the bully of the fo&#8217;castle, and
could look forward to suffering a most finished
trouncing when the sails were all set, the deck
cleared, and the captain&#8217;s watch was piped below.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a good mind to give one of the
mates warning,&#8221; muttered Thank, in my ear, as
the bully went grumbling away at some call to
duty by the dapper little second mate, whom I
already judged to be Mr. Barney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare!&#8221; I admonished. &#8220;That&#8217;s
no way to start. We&#8217;d have all the men down
on us, then. And we don&#8217;t know how many
weeks we may have to sail with them aboard of
this windjammer.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they began to clear up the litter made
by the work of getting under weigh, Thank and
I saw where we could lend a hand, and we did
so. We learned, by talking with the men, that
the Gullwing was short-handed, and that is why
Captain Bowditch, shrewd old Down East
skipper as he was, had so willingly given two
rugged boys, with some knowledge of seamanship,
their passage home. Two men had deserted
at Honolulu, and another had to be
taken ashore to the hospital at Valpariso.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>The ship, we learned, was well found, and the
men gave the officers a good name. Most of
the crew had been with her more than this one
trip. She was owned by the Baltimore firm of
Barney, Blakesley &amp; Knight, and her run had
been out from her home port, touching at
Buenos Ayres, at Valpariso and thence on to
Honolulu and from there to Manila. On her
return voyage she made Honolulu again, Valpariso,
and now hoped to not drop her anchor
until she reached the Virginia Capes.</p>

<p>It was the captain&#8217;s watch that was short and
we were turned over to Mr. Barney, the smart
young second mate. He was a natty, five-foot-nothing
man, whom, if he had voted once, that
was as much as he&#8217;d ever done! But the men
jumped when he spoke to them, and he had a
blue eye that went right through you and Thank
declared&mdash;made the links of your vertebrae
loosen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Gullwing began to travel.
Unless one has stood upon the deck of a great
sailing ship, and looked up into the sky full of
sails that spread above her, it is hard to realize
how fast such a craft can travel through the sea
under a fair wind. Many a seaworthy steamship
would have been glad to make the speed
that the Gullwing did right then, with but a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
fairly cheerful breeze. She made a long tack
to seaward and then a short leg back, and in
that time the Valpariso roadstead was below
the horizon and the outline of the Chilean coast
was but a faint, gray haze from the deck.</p>

<p>We went below, leaving the mate&#8217;s watch to
finish the job. &#8220;Now for it,&#8221; I thought, for
Bully Bob had kept his eye on me most of the
time, and he crowded down the stairs behind me
when I entered the well-lighted and clean fo&#8217;castle
of the four-stick schooner. I expected
he might try to take me foul; for I knew what
sort of fighters these deep-sea ruffians were. As
a whole the crew of the schooner seemed much
above the average; but I believed Bob Promise
needed a good thrashing and I wished with all
my heart that I were able to give it to him.</p>

<p>But if I could keep him off&mdash;make him fight
with his fists alone&mdash;I believed I at least might
put up so good a fight that the other men would
interfere when they considered Bob had given
me my lesson. I hated the thought of being
knocked down and stamped on, or kicked about
the fo&#8217;castle floor. I had seen two of the
men fight aboard the Gypsey Girl and a more
brutal exhibition I never hope to witness.</p>

<p>So I kept my eye on Bob, as he watched me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
and drew off my coat and tightened my belt the
moment I got below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting ready for that beating are you?&#8221; he
demanded, with an evil smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you won&#8217;t insist,&#8221; I said. &#8220;But if
I&#8217;ve got to take it, I suppose I must. All I
have to say, is, that I hope you other men will
see fair play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can lay to that, younker,&#8221; declared the
big fellow who had held the wheel. He was an
old man, but as powerful as a gorilla. &#8220;Give
&#8217;em room, boys, and don&#8217;t interfere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken when the bully made
for me. His intention was, quite evidently, to
catch me around the waist, pinion my arms, and
throw me. But I determined to be caught by
no such wrestler&#8217;s trick. The ship was sailing
on an even keel and I was light of foot. Just
before the bully reached me I stepped aside and
drove my right fist with all my might into his
neck as he passed me.</p>

<p>Goodness! but he went down with a crash.
Big as he was I had fairly lifted him from his
feet. The men roared with delight, and slapped
their thighs and each other&#8217;s backs. I could
see that they were going to enjoy this set-to if I
lasted any length of time against my antagonist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; I cried, before Bob Promise had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
managed to pick himself up, and believing that
my first blow had won me the sympathy of the
majority. &#8220;This man has all the advantage of
weight and age over me. If he&#8217;ll stand up and
fight clean with his fists, I&#8217;ll do my best to meet
him. But I won&#8217;t stand for rough work, or
clinches. He&#8217;ll best me in a minute, wrestling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy speaks true,&#8221; declared the hairy
man. &#8220;And I tell you what, mates. It ain&#8217;t
clear in my mind what the fight&#8217;s about, or
who&#8217;s in the wrong. But the lad shall have his
way. If you try to grab him, or use your feet,
Bob, I&#8217;ll pull you off him with my own two hands
and break you in two! Mark that, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried the irrepressible Thank.
&#8220;Go to it, Sharp! I believe you can win out.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter III</span></h2>


<p class="ph1"><i>In Which the Bubble of My Conceit Is Pricked</i></p>
</div>

<p>Now this is no place to report the details of a
fight of this character. It is all well and good for
a boy to learn to box; it is one of the cleanest
sports there is. It teaches one to be quick of
eye and foot, inculcates courage, gives even a
naturally timid person confidence, and aids
wind and muscle. But the game should be
played only with soft gloves&mdash;never with bare
fists.</p>

<p>Maybe once or twice in the average boy&#8217;s life
will he need the knowledge gained in the
gymnasium to save himself from a beating. I
think now I should have sidestepped this
trouble with Bob Promise, and could have done
so with no loss of honor or self-respect.</p>

<p>But as I saw how lubberly the fellow was, and
how clumsy he was on his feet, I was fired with
the conceit that I had a chance to hold my own
in the contest. And so I did.</p>

<p>I passed my watch to Thank and claimed two-minute
rounds; he acted as timekeeper while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
the gorilla man was referee. We fought altogether
five rounds, and during that time my
antagonist only managed to reach me half a
dozen times, and only once did he knock me to
the deck.</p>

<p>I was pretty fresh at the end of this time,
while Bob was blowing like a porpoise, I had
closed one of his eyes, and his face was bleeding
where my knuckles had cut him deeply. During
the last round I noticed that the men had kept
mighty quiet, and as the big fellow stepped in
between us when Thank announced the end of
the round, I saw Mr. Barney, the second mate,
standing behind me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s enough, boys,&#8221; said the little
second mate, good-naturedly enough. &#8220;They&#8217;re
not matched by the rules you are following.
This young fellow will soon have Bob groggy.
The boy&#8217;s got all the science and Bob has no
show.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was putting it in a light that vexed me.
I had thought <i>I</i> was the one to earn sympathy,
not the bully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; I complained, &#8220;he pitched on me for
nothing. And he outweighs me thirty pound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you outweigh <i>me</i> twenty pound, you
young bantam, you!&#8221; laughed the second mate.
&#8220;Come! I&#8217;m a better match for you than Bob is.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>I flushed pretty red at that, for although I
saw Mr. Barney was a man to respect, I did not
think he handled his watch by the weight of his
muscle.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t think so, put up your hands
again, and we&#8217;ll try a bout,&#8221; said Mr. Barney,
still laughing. &#8220;If you give me the kind of an
eye Bob has, I won&#8217;t chalk it up against you.
The boys will tell you that if there&#8217;s anything
aboard the old Gullwing, it&#8217;s fair dealing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s right for ye, Mr. Barney!&#8221; exclaimed
the gorilla man. Then he winked at
me. &#8220;Hit him as hard as ye kin, boy!&#8221; he
whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; said the mate, buttoning his
jacket tight and taking his position. &#8220;You
won&#8217;t have to fight the whole crew to get a
standing.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw he meant it, and I knew by his smile
that he was a fair-minded man and wished me
no harm. I secretly thought, too, that I was
as good as he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time!&#8221; called Thank, rather shakily.</p>

<p>The very next second something happened to
me that I hadn&#8217;t expected. I thought I could
parry his first blow, at least; but it landed under
my jaw and every tooth in my head rattled. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
leaped back and he followed me up with a swiftness
that made me blink.</p>

<p>I parried several more swift blows and then
hit out myself when I thought I saw my chance.
He just moved his head a trifle to one side and
my fist shot by. My whole weight went with it
and I collided against him. He only rocked a
little on his feet, and as I dodged back he struck
me a blow on the chest that drove me half a
dozen yards into the arms of the spectators.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had placed that higher up&mdash;as I might&mdash;you
would have been asleep, my lad,&#8221; he said,
coolly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, sir,&#8221; I said, panting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am just as much better than you, as you
are than Bob,&#8221; he said, laughing again. &#8220;He
has no science and you have a little. But I
have more science and so we&#8217;re not fairly
matched. And now, boys, that&#8217;s fun enough for
to-day,&#8221; and he turned on his heel and went up
on deck.</p>

<p>I tell you right now, I felt pretty foolish.
But the men didn&#8217;t laugh. The big man, whom
I learned later was Tom Thornton, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a smart little bit of a man, is Mr. Jim
Barney. You might be proud to be put out
by him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me!&#8221; I returned, feeling to see if all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
my teeth were sound. &#8220;No kicking mule has
got anything on him when he hits you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And his brother Alf, on the Seamew, is a
match for him,&#8221; said another of the men.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a pair of them&mdash;brothers and twins,
and as much alike as two peas in a pod. I mind
the time they was looking for some men down
in a joint on Front Street, Baltimore, and a
gang started in to clean &#8217;em up. Thought they
was dudes trying to be rounders. The Barney
boys held off a dozen of them till the police came,
and neither of them even showed a scratch.&#8221;</p>

<p>I pulled myself together and went over to
Bob, who was swabbing his face in a bucket of
water. I held out my hand to him, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The second mate was right. If we&#8217;d fought
rough and tumble you could have easily fixed
me. But you&#8217;ve got lots of muscle and I bet
that second mate doesn&#8217;t sail without a set of
gloves in his cabin. If he&#8217;ll lend &#8217;em to us I&#8217;ll
teach you what little I know myself about
boxing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fair enough!&#8221; shouted Tom Thornton.
&#8220;The boy&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m game,&#8221; growled Bob, giving me his
hand. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t like fresh kids.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Mebbe I&#8217;ll get
salted a little before the voyage is over.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>And so the affair ended in a laugh. But I
guess I learned one lesson that I was not likely
to forget in a hurry.</p>

<p>And both Thankful Polk and I had a whole
lot to learn about this big ship. Although my
chum had been five years from home (leaving
his native village in the hills of Georgia when he
was twelve) he had learned little seamanship.
Nowadays ships do not receive apprentices as
they used to in the palmy days of the American
merchant marine, which is a regrettable fact,
for it was from the class of apprentices that most
of our best shipmasters came.</p>

<p>A seaman&mdash;a real A. B.&mdash;must know every
part of the ship he serves, its rigging and whatnot,
just as any other journeyman tradesman
must know his business. It is not necessary
that an able seaman should be a navigator; but
every navigator should be an able seaman. Such
a man likewise should be something of a sailmaker,
rigger and shipbuilder. In these days
when the work of a crew is so divided that men
are stationed at certain work in all weathers
few men before the mast are all-round seamen.
And this is likewise regrettable.</p>

<p>In the months I had spent upon the Scarboro
I had learned much&mdash;and in that I had the advantage
of Thank. Captain Rogers and Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
Robbins were both thorough-going seamen, and
when we were not chasing whales I had been
drilled by the mate, and by young Ben Gibson,
the second officer, in the ropes, the spars, the
handling of gear, and taught to take my trick
at the wheel with the best man aboard.</p>

<p>And I was thankful for all this now, for although
the Gullwing was a much larger ship,
and differently rigged from the whaler, I could
catch hold now pretty well when an order was
given. I knew, too, that men like Captain
Bowditch and Mr. Gates and Mr. Barney liked
their hands to be smart, and I was not afraid to
tackle anything alow or aloft.</p>

<p>The men told me, too, that &#8220;the old man&#8221;
(which is a term given the captain aboard ship
not at all disrespectful in meaning) was a terror
for crowding on sail. Besides, there was a
deeper reason for Captain Bowditch wishing to
put his ship through the seas and reaching Baltimore
just as soon as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye see,&#8221; said old Tom Thornton, in the dog-watch
that afternoon, &#8220;the firm owns another
ship like the Gullwing&mdash;the very spittin&#8217; image
of it&mdash;the Seamew. They&#8217;re sister ships; built
in the same dockyard, at the same time, and by
the very same plans. A knee, or a deck plank,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
out o&#8217; either one would fit exactly into the
similar space in the other&mdash;and vicy varsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;They was put into commission the same
month, and they make the same v&#8217;yges, as
usual. Cap&#8217;n Si Somes, of the Seamew is about
the same age as our skipper. They was raised
together down east; they went to sea together
in their first ship. And they got their tickets
at the same time, since which they&#8217;ve always
served in different ships, one mounting a notch
when the other did. Rivals, ye&#8217;d call them, but
good friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;re always and forever trying to
best each other in a v&#8217;yge. They races from the
minute they cast off moorings at Baltimore to
the minute they&#8217;re towed inter their berths
again. They crowd on sail, and work their
crews like kildee, and stow their cargoes, and
unload the same like they was racin&#8217; against
time. And now, this trip, they&#8217;ve got a wager
up,&#8221; and old Tom chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was this here way: We battened down
hatches the same morning the Seamew did at
Baltimore, and the tugs was a-swinging of us
out. Cap&#8217;n Si sung out from his poop: &#8216;Joe!
I bet ye an apple I tie up here afore you do when
the v&#8217;yge is over.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I take ye,&#8217; says our skipper, &#8216;pervidin&#8217; it&#8217;s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Rhode Islan&#8217; Greenin&#8217;&mdash;I ain&#8217;t sunk my teeth
into no other kind for forty year&mdash;it&#8217;s the kind
I got my first stomach-ache from eatin&#8217; green,
when I was a kid.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that settled it. The bet was on,&#8221;
chuckled Tom. &#8220;And we fellers for&#8217;ard have
suffered for it, now I tell ye! The Seamew beat
us to Buenos Ayres by ten hours on the outward
v&#8217;yge. We caught her up, weathered the Horn
and was unloading at Valpariso when the Seamew
arrived. But, by jinks! she beat us to
Honolulu.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How was that?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Made a better passage. We got some top-hamper
carried away in a squall. To tell you
the truth, Cap&#8217;n Joe carried on too much sail
for such a blow. But we weren&#8217;t long behind
her at Manila, and my soul! how Cap&#8217;n Joe did
make those Chinks work unloadin&#8217; an&#8217; then
stowin&#8217; cargo again when we started back.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Seamew got away two days before we
did. But we left Honolulu a few hours ahead
of her, and she has to touch at Guayaquil&mdash;up
in Equidor. As far as time and distance goes,
however, both ships is about even. We had to
unload a lot of stuff back there at Valpariso,
and load again. Both are hopin&#8217; not to touch
nowheres till we git home. And it wouldn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
surprise me none if we sighted the Seamew almost
any day now, unless she&#8217;s clawed too far
off shore.&#8221;</p>

<p>This good-natured competition between the
two big ships had, I believe, something to do
with the smart way in which the crew of this
one on which I sailed went about their work.
Jack Tar is supposed to be a chronic grumbler;
and surely the monotony of life at sea may get
on the nerves of the best man afloat; but I
seldom heard any grumbling in the fo&#8217;castle of
the Gullwing.</p>

<p>However, there was another rivalry connected
with this voyage of the sister ships&mdash;a much
more serious matter&mdash;and, indeed, one that
proved tragic in the end, but of this I was yet
to learn the particulars in the eventful days
that followed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter IV</span></h2>


<p class="ph1"><i>In Which Captain Bowditch Crowds On Sail and
There Is Much Excitement</i></p>
</div>

<p>In writing a story of the sea&mdash;even a narrative
of personal experiences&mdash;it is difficult to
give the reader a proper idea of the daily life
of the man before the mast. It naturally falls
that the high lights of adventure are accentuated
while the shadows of monotony are very faint
indeed. But the sailor&#8217;s life is no sinecure.</p>

<p>Saving on occasion the work on shipboard
is not very hard. The watch-and-watch system
followed on all ships makes the work easy in
fair weather; and foul weather lasts but for
short spells, save in certain portions of the two
hemispheres.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eight bells! Rise and shine!&#8221;</p>

<p>This order, shouted into the fo&#8217;castle at four
o&#8217;clock in the morning, roused Thankful Polk
and I from our berths. No turning over for
another nap&mdash;or for even a wink of sleep&mdash;with
that command ringing in one&#8217;s ears. We
tumbled out, got into our outer clothing, ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
our fingers through our hair (no chance for any
fancy toilets at this hour) and went on deck
with the other members of the captain&#8217;s watch.</p>

<p>There was plenty of light by which to chore
around, and Mr. Barney&#8217;s sharp voice kept us
stirring until five when we lined up at the galley
door and each man got a tin of hot coffee&mdash;and
good coffee it was too, aboard the Gullwing.
Then buckets and brooms was the order and
the ship began to be slopped and scrubbed from
the bowsprit to the rudder timbers. No housewife
was ever half as thorough as we had to be
to satisfy Mr. Barney and the old man. Thank
and I learned that Captain Bowditch made a
tour of the deck every morning after breakfast,
and if there had been any part of the work
skimped he would call up the watch and have
the whole job done over again.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that don&#8217;t happen more&#8217;n once on a
v&#8217;yage,&#8221; chuckled Tom Thornton, working beside
us. &#8220;The feller that skips any part of the
work he&#8217;s set to do on this here packet, gets to
be mighty onpopular with his mates.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus warned, we two boys were very careful
with our share of the scrubbing&mdash;and likewise
the coiling down of ropes which followed. I
can assure the reader that, when we were
through, everything in sight was as spick and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
span as it could be&mdash;every stain was holystoned
from the deck, the white paint glistened, and
the brasswork shone.</p>

<p>At seven-thirty the watch below was given
breakfast and at four bells&mdash;eight o&#8217;clock&mdash;we
were relieved and went below to our own
breakfast; and that was not a bad meal aboard
the Gullwing. There are no fancy dishes
tacked onto Jack Tar&#8217;s bill of fare&mdash;nor does he
expect it; but on this ship food was served with
some regard to decency.</p>

<p>On the Gypsey Girl &#8220;souse&#8221; was served in a
bucket, set down in the middle of the long fo&#8217;castle
table, and every man scooped his cup into
the mess, broke in his hardtack, and inhaled it a
good deal after the style of a pig at a trough.
But for breakfast on this ship there was more
good coffee, tack that was not mouldy and scraps
of meat and potatoes fried together&mdash;a hearty,
satisfying meal.</p>

<p>Each man washed and put away his own cup,
plate and knife and fork. Some used their
gulleys, or sheath-knives; but Thank and I had
brought aboard proper table tools in our dunnage
bags. After the breakfast was cleared
away, and the fo&#8217;castle itself tidied up, the
watch below busied itself in mending, sock darning,
and such like odd jobs. A sailor has got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
to be his own tailor, seamstress and housewife;
and even such a horny-handed and tar-fingered
giant as Tom Thornton was mighty handy with
his needle and &#8220;sailor&#8217;s palm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some of the men shaved at this time, one cut
another&#8217;s hair and trimmed his beard. The
crew of the Gullwing respected themselves; the
deck of the fo&#8217;castle was kept as well scrubbed
as the deck above. Nobody came to the table
without having scrubbed his face and hands
clean; nor was the men&#8217;s clothing foul with
tar or the grease of the running gear. They
may all have been &#8220;sword-swallowers&#8221; when it
came to &#8220;stowing their cargo &#8217;tween hatches,&#8221;
but cleanliness was the order, and the ordinary
decencies of life were not ignored. These men
may not have been particularly strong on
etiquette, and were not &#8220;parlor broke,&#8221; as the
saying is; but they were neat, accommodating,
cheerful, and if they skylarked some, it was fun
of a good-natured kind and was not objectionable.</p>

<p>I liked old Tom Thornton, for despite the
cast in his eye, and his gorilla-like appearance,
he was good hearted. He was just about
covered with tattooing, I reckon. As he said,
if he&#8217;d wanted to take any more indigo into his
system he&#8217;d have to swallow it! Most of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
work had been done on him by a South Sea
Islander who had sailed in whaling ships and
the like and made a little &#8220;on the side&#8221; by
tattooing pictures on foolish sailors.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Taint done now, no more,&#8221; old Tom said,
shaking his head. &#8220;But when I was a youngster
it was the fashion. Poor Jack can&#8217;t afford to
buy picters and have a family portrait gallery,
or the like. But he used to be strong for art,&#8221;
and the old man grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wrecked with this here nigger-man I
tell you about. About all he saved from the
wreck was his colors and bone needles, and the
patterns he outlined his figgers from. We was
held prisoner on that blamed reef, living on
stuff from the wreck, for three months. There
wasn&#8217;t nothing else to do. His tattooing me
kept him from going crazy, and the smart of the
thing kept me alive. So there you have it&mdash;tit
for tat! He never charged me nothing for
his work, neither, and I allus was a great lad for
gittin&#8217; a good deal for my money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s legs were mural paintings of serpents
and sea monsters. He had anklets and bracelets
worked in red and blue. On his back was a
picture of three gallows with a man hanging in
chains from the middle one. I believe that it
was the ignorant South Sea native&#8217;s idea of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
story of Calvary, for there was the typical
cross and crown worked above it at the back of
Tom&#8217;s neck. The mermaid on Tom&#8217;s chest
could have won a job as fat woman with a
traveling circus; but then, Tom had an enormous
chest which had given the tattooer plenty
of space to work on. Around his waist was
tattooed a belt like a lattice-work fence. When
he stripped to &#8220;sluice down,&#8221; as he called his
daily bath, he looked as gay as a billboard.</p>

<p>At ten o&#8217;clock (six bells) of the forenoon watch
most of the watch below turned in for a nap, and
at half past eleven we answered the call to
dinner. At noon we were on duty again until
four o&#8217;clock. In pleasant weather this afternoon
watch is a mighty easy one. Besides the
man at the wheel and the two on lookout, the
others haven&#8217;t much to do but tell stories, play
checkers, or read. As long as everything was
neat and shipshape the old man did not hound
us to work at odd jobs as some masters do.</p>

<p>From four to eight p. m. the time is divided
into two dog-watches, although the second half
of that spell is the actual dog-watch. &#8220;Dog&#8221;
is a corruption of &#8220;dodge,&#8221; the object of this
division being to make an even number of
watches to the twenty-four hours so that there
will be a daily changing or shifting, thus dodging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
the routine. For example, the watch that goes
below one day at noon will the next day come on
deck at that hour.</p>

<p>At five-thirty our watch had supper and at six
we took the deck once more until eight o&#8217;clock.
Then we could sleep until midnight and from
thence had the watch until four in the morning.
It is a monotonous round&mdash;especially in fair
weather. We were like to welcome a bit of a
blow now and then, although the Gullwing was
such a big ship, and her crew was so small, that
all hands had to turn out to shorten or make
sail. On some ships this fact would have made
the crew ugly but these boys had even a good
word for the cook or &#8220;doctor,&#8221; and usually
Jack looks upon that functionary as his natural
enemy.</p>

<p>But during those first few days of the run down
the coast of Chile it was seldom that we were
called on to shorten sail. Captain Bowditch
was living up to his reputation; the Gullwing
foamed along through the short green seas
with every sail she would bear spread to the
favoring gale. With her four whole sails on
the lower spars and all her jibs set, she spread
a vast amount of canvas to the wind. And the
only changes we made were in her topsails.
Those the skipper kept spread every moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
that he dared; and it took a pretty strong gust
to make him give the order to reef down.</p>

<p>When he left the deck himself, either day or
night, he instructed his mates to call him before
they took in an inch of cloth. And Mr. Gates
and Mr. Barney were just as hungry for speed,
as the old man. The Gullwing was heavily
laden, but there was probably few stiffer
vessels at sea that day than she. With plenty
of ballast there was no gale or no sea that could
capsize her.</p>

<p>She took cheerfully all the wind and all the
sea could give her. A little loose water flopping
around her deck didn&#8217;t trouble Captain Bowditch.
&#8220;Tarpaulin her hatches, clamp &#8217;em
down, and let her roll!&#8221; had been his order when
we had got well away from our anchorage at
Valpariso. We had good weather, however, as
I have said, for some days.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, one afternoon in the first dog-watch,
it came on to blow. Carefully as the
captain watched the glass, I do not think this
squall was foretold. A more cautious navigator
might have been better prepared for a
squall. He wouldn&#8217;t have had his topsails
spread in any such gale as had been blowing.
And when all hands were called to go aloft, the
wind shrieked down upon us and the foretopsail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
and two staysails were blown clean out of
the boltropes before the men could get at them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are ye about, ye sawneys!&#8221; yelled
Captain Bowditch, dancing up and down on the
deck and shaking his fists at the men above.
&#8220;Save my sails for me! Think I&#8217;m <i>made</i> o&#8217;
sailcloth? And them right new fixin&#8217;s, too! Git
busy there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, we were busy! I had been sent aloft and
so had Thank. We were nimble enough in the
shrouds; but we were not as smart about
handling the stiff canvas as some. I found my
chum beside me as we hauled down the stiff
canvas upon the spar, and threw ourselves upon
the folds to hold them till they could be secured.</p>

<p>&#8220;My law-dee!&#8221; gasped the Georgian boy,
grinning. &#8220;Jest as lives try to pin an apron
around the waist of a baby hippopotamus&mdash;what?&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw his wet, red, grinning face for a moment
looking across at me. Then, suddenly, the ship
keeled over, the rope on which we stood overhung
those leaping, green, froth-streaked waves&mdash;waves
which seemed hungrily trying to lap
our feet. Thank disappeared! Something gave
way, his weight left the sail to me alone. And
perhaps, fearful for my chum, I bore off the
canvas myself to look for him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>The next instant I was cast back by the wind
tearing under the canvas and lifting it in a great
balloon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Swish&mdash;r-r-rip!&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a banshee on a broomstick that sail
kited off to leeward, and I was left hanging
desperately to the shrouds, with the wind booming
in my ears so that I could not even hear the
angry roaring of the skipper below.</p>

<p>And all the time this question kept thumping
in my head: &#8220;Where was Thankful Polk?&#8221;</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter V</span></h2>


<p class="ph1"><i>In Which We See a Ship Sailing in the Sky</i></p>
</div>

<p>I had forgotten my own peril. Indeed, so
disturbed was I for the moment for my chum&#8217;s
safety that I cared nothing for the lost sail. I
yelled for Thank at the top of my voice, though
doubtless the shrieking of the wind drowned all
sound of my cries. And Thank, for all I knew,
was already far to leeward, fighting in that
tempestuous sea.</p>

<p>And then suddenly, through a rift in the flying
spray that stung my face so cruelly and almost
blinded me, I beheld something swinging
from the ropes on which I stood. The ship was
almost on her beam-ends and the waves broke
just below me. There Thank hung by his foot,
which had twisted in the ropes and was held
firm, his head and shoulders buried in the foaming
sea at every plunge of the laboring Gullwing!</p>

<p>I shrieked again and, clinging with one hand
with a desperate grip, I sought to seize him as
he swung, pendulum-like, to and fro. <i>I could
not reach him.</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>But now the brave ship was righting herself.
We rose higher and higher from the leaping
waves. Thank swung back and forth and, as
we came inboard, I feared he would batter his
poor brains out against the wire cables, or
against some spar.</p>

<p>He was unconscious. He was helpless. And
it seemed as though I was helpless as well.
Those few momentous seconds showed me
plainly how deeply I loved the youth who had
been my comrade in adventure and labor and
peril during these last few months. I had
never had a chum before of my own age&mdash;not
one whom I had really cottoned to. Thank
was as dear to me as a brother would have been.</p>

<p>As we rose higher and higher another fear
smote me. If his foot loosened now and he
fell, he would be dashed to death upon the deck
below. In my struggles my hand found a
loose rope. I hauled it in quickly, hung to the
spar by my elbows while I formed a noose in the
end, and was unsuccessfully trying to get this
over Thank&#8217;s head and shoulders when another
man sprang to the footrope beside me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Git down there and grab him!&#8221; yelled this
individual in my ear. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hold you both.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Bob Promise and although he was the
man aboard whom I least liked, he was an angel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
of mercy to me just then. I knew his muscle
and vigor. With one hand he clung to the rope
and seized my belt with his other paw. I knew
that belt would hold, and I swung myself, without
question, head-downward.</p>

<p>It was only for a moment that he had to be
under the strain of all my weight and Thank&#8217;s
as well. Then I had scrambled back to the
footrope, and held my chum in the hollow of my
arm. Thank was half drowned, but his eyes
opened and he gasped out something or other
before Bob steadied us both again upon the footrope.
Later I realized that he tried to say, in
his cheerful way: &#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Sharp!&#8221;</p>

<p>Between us Bob and I managed to get him
down to the deck. We should not have been
able to do that without a sling had the squall
not passed away and left the old Gullwing once
more on a comparatively level keel.</p>

<p>When we landed upon the deck boards, Thank
managed to stand erect. And we three shook
hands with a sort of grim satisfaction. I don&#8217;t
think any of us ever spoke of the event thereafter,
and our mates had not seen our peril,
but we three were not likely to forget it.</p>

<p>The old man was still careening around the
quarter, like a hen on a hot skillet, fussing about
the lost sails. And scarcely had the squall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
passed when he was ordering up new ones to
replace those that had been lost. We went to
work bending on the fresh sails while it was yet
blowing so hard that most captains would have
kept their crews out of the rigging.</p>

<p>I began to see that Tom Thornton had not
been joking when he said that the men were
paying the penalty for the skipper&#8217;s betting an
apple with Captain Si Somes, of the Seamew.
Had it been a thousand dollars at stake, Captain
Bowditch would have been no more earnest in
his determination to beat the Gullwing&#8217;s sister
ship.</p>

<p>But the wind was little more than a stiff gale
when the new sails were set and the ripping repaired.
We drove along until night and then
the air became very light. During the night a
fog began to gather and when our watch was
called at eight bells in the morning it was pretty
thick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like a Cape Horn soup,&#8221; growled old
Tom, as he stepped on deck. &#8220;Though we&#8217;re a
good bit of a ways from that latitude yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>As we stumbled around the deck, doing that
everlasting cleaning up that Mr. Barney watched
so sharply, the fog began to thin and waver.
Somewhere overhead there was a breeze; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
it was pretty near a dead calm down here on the
deck of the Gullwing.</p>

<p>By the time the sun began to glow upon the
edge of the sea, looking like a great argand lamp
in the fog; overhead the billows of mist were
rolling in imitation of the long, swinging swell
of the sea itself. At first those billows in the
sky glowed in purple, and rose hues, ever changing,
magnificently beautiful! It was a seascape
long to be remembered.</p>

<p>The sun rose higher. Its rays shot through
the rolling mist like arrows. Now and then
the breeze breathed on our sails and the Gullwing
forged ahead at a better pace. The fog
left us. We were sailing in an open space, it
seemed, with the mist bank encircling us at a
distance on a few cable-lengths, and the billows
still rolling high above the points of our masts.</p>

<p>And then, to the westward, the curtains rolled
back as it seemed for the scene that had been
set for us. Like the stage of a great theatre,
this setting of cloud and mist and heaving sea
appeared, and there, sailing with her keel in the
clouds, and her tapering masts and shaking
sails pointing seaward, was a beautiful, misty,
four-stick schooner.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about that?&#8221; demanded
Thankful Polk. &#8220;Do you see what I see, Sharp,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
or have I &#8216;got &#8217;em?&#8217; That ship&#8217;s upside down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mirage,&#8221; I murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a Jim Hickey of a sight, whatever the
right name of it is,&#8221; he rejoined.</p>

<p>Everybody else on deck was aware of the
mirage, and a chorus of exclamations arose from
the watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Gullwing herself!&#8221; ejaculated Bob
Promise. &#8220;Of course it is! It&#8217;s a four-sticker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you make that out?&#8221; demanded
Thank. &#8220;I know derned well <i>I</i> ain&#8217;t standing
on my head, whatever you be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s her reflection, sawney!&#8221; said somebody
else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! well I reckoned that I knew whether I
was on my head, or my heels,&#8221; chuckled the
boy from Georgia.</p>

<p>But I had been watching the mirage very
sharply. I knew just what sails were set upon
the Gullwing, and I counted those upon the
ship in the sky. Misty as the reflection was I
could distinguish them plainly. And suddenly
I saw a movement among those sails. <i>Sharply
defined figures of men swarmed into her
rigging.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not the Gullwing at all!&#8221; I shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;That boy&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Mr. Barney sharply,
coming out of the afterhouse with his glass, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
with the captain right behind him. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got good eyes on you, Webb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By jinks! It&#8217;s the Seamew!&#8221; roared our
skipper, the moment he set his eyes upon the
mirage. &#8220;And if she&#8217;s sailing that way, she&#8217;ll
never beat us to the Capes of Virginia.&#8221;</p>

<p>A roar of laughter greeted this joke. But the
ship in the sky began immediately to fade away,
and it had soon disappeared, while the wind
freshened with us and we forged ahead still
faster. When the fog completely disappeared
there was not a sail in sight anywhere on that
sea, although Mr. Barney went into the tops
himself and searched the horizon with a glass.</p>

<p>But I know that they made a note of the appearance
on the log. Some of the sailors
thought the Seamew couldn&#8217;t be far from us,
either head or astern; but I knew that the
mirage might have reflected our sister ship
hundreds of miles away. The incident gave us
a deal to talk about, however, and an added
savor to the race we were sailing half around
the globe.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter VI</span></h2>


<p class="ph1"><i>In Which the Gullwing Suffers a Ghostly Visitation</i></p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The words of Agur, the son of Jaketh....
There be three things which are too wonderful
for me, yea, four which I know not: The way
of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent
upon a rock, <i>the way of a ship in the midst of the
sea</i>....&#8221;</p>

<p>That old fellow whose wise sayings make up
the final chapter of the Book of Proverbs had a
deal of experience and knowledge; but navigation
was a mystery to him. And to see a great
ship sailing straight away on her course, in the
midst of the sea, without a sign of land anywhere
about, is like to make one think of the wonder
of it.</p>

<p>We picked up many a sail after the mirage of
our sister ship, during the next few days; but
none of them were the Seamew. The wind increased
and the Gullwing went snoring through
green seas, her bow in a smother of foam and a
good deal of loose water inboard on occasion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
But that did not bother the captain. We were
speeding up toward the Horn and little else
mattered.</p>

<p>We were getting into a colder latitude, too.
Now we were down about to the line where the
Gypsey Girl had steamed in and out of the
channels after seals. But we never saw the
land. The Gullwing was keeping well off shore.</p>

<p>The keen wind blew a fitful gale. We were
glad to get into the lee of the deck-houses when
we were on duty. Thanks to Captain Rogers of
the Scarboro, however, my chum and I were well
dressed for colder weather; but we got each a
suit of tarpaulins and hip boots from Captain
Bowditch, for we had not owned them. We
could safely dress in these water-shedding garments
every watch above, when the weather
was not fair; for the schooner was bound to ship
a deal of suds.</p>

<p>In our watch besides old Tom Thornton, was
another ancient mariner, and the only man not
an American born aboard the Gullwing&mdash;August
Stronson. He was a queer, gentle old man with
the marks of dissipation strong upon his face,
although most of his spare time below he sat and
read a well-thumbed Swedish Bible. He was a
man in whom Alcohol had taken a strangle hold
on Will. A more than ordinarily good seaman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
when ashore he soon became a derelict along the
docks, finally ending in some mission or bethel
where he would be straightened out and a berth
found for him again. He was only safe aboard
ship. Eternally sailing about the Seven Seas
was his salvation.</p>

<p>He was aboard the Gullwing, as Thank and I
were, merely by chance. And his reason for
wishing to make the port of Baltimore was a
curious one&mdash;yet one that gives a sidelight upon
the sailor&#8217;s character. As a usual thing, Jack
is grateful to anybody who does him a kindness,
and he does not often forget a favor done him.
Besides, he prides himself on &#8220;being square.&#8221;
Yet it seemed to me that old Stronson was carrying
that trait farther than most seamen.</p>

<p>He had been picked up at Honolulu by Cap-Bowditch,
after the two men before mentioned
had deserted the Gullwing to go with a native
trader into the South Seas. Stronson had already
traveled by one craft and another from
Australia and would have traveled, when he
reached Baltimore, all of ten thousand miles to
see just one man. He told me this story in one
watch below and I think it worth repeating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Sowle, who iss de superintendent of
that mission where dey iss so goot to sailormans,
lend me a dollar five years ago when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
was sick. I ban goin&#8217; to pay dat dollar, me! I
ban going to Baltimore to pay him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t you send it to him by mail?&#8221;
I asked the old fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Sowle, gif me dat dollar in his own
hand, and I haf to give it back to him mit mine.
I could nefer forget his kindness&mdash;no. In many
foreign ports I thought of him&mdash;how goot he
wass. I long carry that dollar note in my shirt&mdash;yes.
In Sydney I went to the sailor&#8217;s mission
one night and heard an old song das Captain
Sowle sung to me and odders in Baltimore. I
had that dollar note I haf saved mit me den.
Why! I ban shipwrecked once and safe only dot
dollar and a jumper. Luck foller me mit das
dollar.</p>

<p>&#8220;I says to my mate dere in Sydney, &#8216;Bill,&#8217;
I says, &#8216;I got de old man&#8217;s dollar yet. Meppe
he need it for de poys when he sing dot old
hymn to-night over seas.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do you feel uneasy like?&#8217; Bill asks me.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; says I, &#8216;but I seems to hear the old
man singing and I&#8217;m minding the old Bethel and
the winter night he ban givin&#8217; me de dollar.&#8217;
&#8216;Well,&#8217; says Bill, &#8216;you must bring your cargo to
port and get a discharge. You must show de
old man dat you sail straight. That&#8217;s my verdict.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>&#8220;So we shook hands undt I go find me a
berth to Manila&mdash;best I can do just then. I
makes Honolulu on a Pacific Mail; but she drops
me there. Then I finds de Gullwing. She iss
de ship for me,&#8221; added Stronson, smiling in his
simple way. &#8220;She carry me straight for Baltimore,
undt I pay das dollar to Captain Sowle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some of the men made a good deal of fun of
Stronson because he was slow of intellect; but
he was an able seaman and even the sharp-spoken
Mr. Barney seemed to bear easy on the
old man. He was stiff in his joints at times, for
the sailor&#8217;s chief enemy, rheumatism, had got a
grip on Stronson. Thank and I saved him
many a job aloft, and in return he patiently set
about teaching us all he knew about splicing and
knotting&mdash;which was no small job for either
the old man or for us.</p>

<p>It was soon after this that we got the four
days&#8217; gale that I, for one, shall not soon forget.
The wind, however, did not increase so suddenly
as before, and Captain Bowditch took warning
in time and had the small sails furled. But when
the gale fairly struck us we had enough lower
canvas set in all good conscience. The ship
fairly reeled under the sudden stroke of the
blast.</p>

<p>With the wind, too, came the snow. Such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
snowstorm I had not seen for several years, for
we had had two or three mild winters in New
England before I had gone to sea. We were
forced to reef down the big sails, though every
order from the skipper to this end was punctuated
by groans. The canvas was stiff and the
snow froze on it, and we had a mess. Glad was
I that the work was not to be done in the tops.</p>

<p>A smother of snow wrapped the Gullwing
about and we plunged on without an idea as
to what was in our path. The lookout forward
could not see to the end of the jib-boom. The
sea was lashed to fury and, again and again, a
wave broke over our bows and washed the deck
from stem to stern. To add to the wonder of it,
somewhere in the depths of the universe above
us an electrical storm raged; we could hear the
sullen thunder rolling from horizon to horizon.
At first I had thought this was surf on the rocks
and believed we were going head-on to death
and destruction; but the officers knew where we
were and they assured us that the chart gave us
an open sea.</p>

<p>The decks were a mess of slush and it was
dangerous to go about without hanging to the
lifelines that checkrowed the Gullwing from
forward of the fo&#8217;castle to the after companionway.
Yet how the staunch craft sailed! She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
shook the waves off her back like a duck under
a waterspout, and seemed to enjoy the buffeting
of the sea like a thing alive.</p>

<p>While the storm continued we got just such
food as we could grab in our fists. Nothing
was safe on the table. The doctor kept the
coffee hot in some magic way; yet there were
times when the ship rolled so that the lids flew
off his stove and the fire was dumped on the
deck of the galley.</p>

<p>Sixty hours and more of this sort of weather
dragged past. I once said to Tom Thornton:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity the skipper didn&#8217;t try for the
Straits, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what would the Gullwing be doing in
the Straits, in a blow like this, my lad?&#8221; he
demanded. &#8220;A big ship like her in that narrow
way has little chance in a storm. The tail of
such a gale as this would heave her on the rocks.
There&#8217;s not seaway enough there for anything
bigger than a bugeye canoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the Scarboro made a fair course through
it,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That greaser!&#8221; snorted the old A. B. &#8220;She
can loaf along as she pleases. Sea-anchor, if
there&#8217;s a bit of a gale. But the Windjammer
has to make time. These days the big sailin&#8217;
ships hafter compete with them dirty steam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
tramps. We can&#8217;t risk bein&#8217; becalmed in any
narrow waterway&mdash;no, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was on the fourth night, with the wind
blowing a hurricane and the snow as thick about
us as a winding-sheet, that our watch had come
on deck at midnight. I was sent as second man
with Bob Promise to the wheel. It took both
of us to handle the steering gear when the old
schooner kicked and plunged so.</p>

<p>We were under close-reefed mainsail and jibs
and were battling fearful waves. The sleet-like
snow drove across her deck and all but blinded
us. I had to keep wiping the slush off the
binnacle, or the lamp would have been completely
smothered and we could not have seen
the trembling needle.</p>

<p>Sometimes the officer on the quarter was
hidden from our eyes, but his voice reached us
all right:</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady your helm! You lubbers act like
your muscles were mush. Keep off! Can&#8217;t you
hear that sail shaking? You&#8217;ll have us under
sternway yet. Call yourselves sailors? You&#8217;re
a pair of farmers! What d&#8217;ye think you&#8217;re doing?
Plowing with a pair of steers? Steady!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob muttered imprecations on Mr. Barney&#8217;s
head; but I knew better.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;He&#8217;s nervous, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; I said. &#8220;He&#8217;s
always so when the skipper ain&#8217;t on deck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All he thinks of is whether we&#8217;re beatin&#8217; the
Seamew, or not,&#8221; growled Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;I notice that bothers him,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But
he hasn&#8217;t bet a Greening apple on the race, has
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bigger than that, I reckon. They say
it&#8217;s something betwixt him and his brother Alf.
They&#8217;ve been sore on each other for a year or
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew Mr. Alfred Barney was second mate
of the Seamew, and I wondered what the
trouble was between the twin brothers.</p>

<p>But just as this moment something happened
that gave our minds a slant in another direction.
The snow squall had thinned. We could see
pretty near the length of the deck from where
we stood&mdash;Bob and I&mdash;at the wheel.</p>

<p>Suddenly my mate uttered a stifled yell and
his hands dropped from the spokes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looker there!&#8221; he gasped.</p>

<p>I hung to the wheel, although a kick of the
schooner near sent me on my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Catch hold here, confound you!&#8221; I bawled.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he cried again, pointing with a
terror stiffened arm into the forerigging.</p>

<p>I saw a flash of light&mdash;a glow like that of a big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
incandescent lamp bulb. It hung for fully
thirty seconds to the very tip of one of the fore-topmast
spars. Again, another flashed upon
another point of the rigging. Bob Promise
crouched by the wheel; he fairly groveled, while
I could hear cries and groans from many of the
hands on deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you? What is it?&#8221;
I demanded, still fighting with the wabbling
wheel alone; and I am afraid I kicked him.
&#8220;Catch hold here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Corpse lights!&#8221; groaned Bob, not even resenting
my foot. &#8220;We&#8217;re all dead men. We&#8217;re
doomed.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter VII</span></h2>


<p class="ph1"><i>In Which Is Pictured a Race in Mid-Ocean</i></p>
</div>

<p>There was a snapping and crackling in the air
over the laboring ship. It sounded as though
the taut stays were giving way, one after another.
For the moment, what Bob said about &#8220;corpse
lights&#8221; I did not understand; I was mainly
giving my attention to the wheel.</p>

<p>But the ship came to an even keel for a minute
and I was able to hold her on her course, and get
my breath. Then I beheld the strange lights
shining here, there, and everywhere about the
rigging, and I was amazed. Not that I was
frightened, as Bob and some of the others of the
watch appeared to be. The sailor is a very
superstitious person; and let him tell it, there
are enough strange things happen at sea to convince
a most philosophical mind that there is a
spirit world very, very close to our own mundane
sphere. There&#8217;s a very thin veil between the
two, and at times that veil is torn away.</p>

<p>But I knew in a minute that what Bob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
meant by &#8220;corpse lights&#8221; were corposant lights
and were an electric display better known as
&#8220;St. Elmo&#8217;s fire.&#8221; The lights were globular in
shape, and about four inches in diameter.
There were apparently a score of them all
through the rigging, and they appeared at
intervals of a minute, or two. The driving
sleet could not hide them, and the fires illuminated
the ship and the sea for some distance
around her.</p>

<p>It certainly was a queer sight, and the brilliance
of the corposant lights was very marked.
I heard Mr. Barney shouting from his station:</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your shirts on, you hardshells! They
won&#8217;t bite&mdash;nor none o&#8217; you ain&#8217;t got to go aloft
to put &#8217;em out. There&#8217;s one sure thing about
them lights&mdash;they won&#8217;t set the rigging afire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up and take hold of this wheel, Bob,&#8221;
I exclaimed, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll yell for help. I can&#8217;t
handle her proper if she plunges again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got up shakingly and took hold. When
the sea was sucked away from the bow of the
Gullwing next time we held her on her course.
But my companion was still frightened and
looked at the glowing lights askance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Holding your own there at the wheel, boys?&#8221;
demanded Mr. Barney.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir!&#8221; I replied, but Bob didn&#8217;t even
whisper.</p>

<p>Suddenly the last light disappeared&mdash;as suddenly
as the first had appeared&mdash;and immediately
there was a loud explosion over our
heads and Mr. Barney pitched down the ladder
to the deck. Several of the other men were
flung to the deck, too, and Bob gave another
frightened yell and started forward on a dead
run.</p>

<p>He collided with Captain Bowditch, who had
just shot up through the companionway.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this, you swab?&#8221; yelled the skipper,
grabbing Bob by the collar with one hand and
seizing a rope with the other, as the ship staggered
again. &#8220;What d&#8217;ye mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he saw Mr. Barney just scrambling to
his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this mutinous swab been doing,
sir?&#8221; added the captain.</p>

<p>The second mate explained in a moment.
But Bob suffered. The old man was in a towering
rage because he had left his post.</p>

<p>&#8220;You flat-footed son of a sea-cook!&#8221; he
bawled, shaking Promise, big as he was, like a
drowned kitten. &#8220;What d&#8217;ye mean by leaving
the wheel? That boy yonder kept his place
didn&#8217;t he? Scared of a light, be ye? Why, if a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
sea-sarpint came aboard that wouldn&#8217;t be no
excuse for your leaving the helm. Git back
there!&#8221;</p>

<p>And when he started Bob aft again he accelerated
his motions with a vigorous kick in
the broad of the seaman&#8217;s back. Bob grabbed
the spokes of the wheel, and braced himself,
with a face like a thundercloud. I crowded
down my amusement and perhaps it is well I
did. The fellow was in no mood for enduring
chaffing. When a man is both angry and scared
a joke doesn&#8217;t appeal to him&mdash;much.</p>

<p>I am reminded that this is a sorry scene to
depict. Yet Captain Bowditch was a kindly
man and not given to unjust punishments.
And I believe that Bob got only what he deserved.
Even terror cannot excuse a man for
neglecting his duty, especially at sea. It is
like a private in the ranks enduring the natural
fear of a first charge against the enemy. No
matter what he may feel in his trembling soul,
for the sake of the example he sets the man
next to him, he must crowd down that fear and
press on!</p>

<p>The storm had broken, however. At daylight
we found that four feet of the fore-topmast
had been snapped off short, whether by the
electrical explosion, or by the wind, we could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
tell. But that was the end of that bad spell of
weather, thanks be! The Gullwing sailed
through it, we spliced on a new spar, trimmed our
sails, and tore on, under a goodly press of canvas,
for the Horn.</p>

<p>But several of the crew remained gloomy because
of the &#8220;corpse lights.&#8221; Something was
bound to happen&mdash;of course, something unlucky.
The lights had foretold it. And Stronson, with
Tom Thornton and other of the old salts, told
weird tales in the dog-watch.</p>

<p>In spite of the hurricane we had made good
time in this run from Valparaiso. As far as I
could see, however, nothing momentous happened
at once; and the next important incident
that went down in the ship&#8217;s log was the sighting
of the Seamew.</p>

<p>We really saw her this time&mdash;&#8220;in the flesh,&#8221;
not a ghostly mirage. She came out of the murk
of fog to the south&#8217;ard at dawn and, far away as
she was, the lookout identified her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seamew, ahoy!&#8221; he yelled.</p>

<p>It brought all hands upon deck&mdash;even the
mate himself who had just turned in, and the
captain, too. There the sister of the Gullwing
sailed, her canvas spread to the freshening morning
breeze, her prow throwing off two high foamy
waves as she tacked toward us.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>She was on one tack; we were on the other.
Therefore we were approaching each other
rapidly. And what a sight! If a marine artist
could have painted the picture of that beautiful
ship, with her glistening paint, and pearl-tinted
sails, and her lithe masts and taut cordage, he
would have had a picture worth looking at.
And from her deck the Gullwing must have
seemed quite as beautiful to those aboard the
Seamew.</p>

<p>The two ships were the best of their class&mdash;more
trimly modeled than most. I had not
realized before what a beautiful ship the Gullwing
was. I saw her reflected in the Seamew.</p>

<p>She carried an open rail amidships; and her
white painted stations, carved in the shape of
hour-glasses, with the painted flat handrail
atop, stood clearly and sharply defined above
her black lower sides and the pale green seas.</p>

<p>Not that either ship showed much lower
planking, saving when they rolled; they were
heavily laden. With all her jibs and all her
whole sails on the four lower spars, and most of
the small sails spread above, our sister ship
certainly was a beautiful picture.</p>

<p>But the old man wasn&#8217;t satisfied. Through
his glass he saw something that spurred him to
emulation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>&#8220;She&#8217;s got all her t&#8217;gallant-sails set, by
Pollox!&#8221; he bawled. &#8220;Mr. Gates! what are you
moonin&#8217; about? Get them men up there in
short order, or I&#8217;ll be after them myself.&#8221; And
as we jumped into the rigging, I heard him growling
away on the quarter: &#8220;That&#8217;s the way Cap&#8217;n
Si beats us. He crowds on sail, <i>he</i> does. Why, I
bet he never furled a rag durin&#8217; that four-day
breeze we just struck, and like enough had the
crew pin their shirts on the wash line inter the
bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two vessels may be rigged alike and built
alike, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they will sail
exactly alike. The Seamew was a shade faster
in reaching and running than the Gullwing.
Mr. Barney told me that.</p>

<p>&#8220;But to windward we have the best of her.
And that&#8217;s not because of our sailing qualities.
The difference is in the two masters,&#8221; the second
mate said. &#8220;Captain Joe can always get more
out of his ship than Captain Si can out of his
when the going is bad. In fair weather the
Seamew will beat us a little every reach. But it
isn&#8217;t all fair weather in a voyage of ten thousand
miles, or so,&#8221; and he smiled&mdash;I thought&mdash;rather
nastily.</p>

<p>I was reminded of the hint Bob Promise had
given me that there was bad blood and no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
pleasant rivalry between our second mate and
the twin who held the same berth on our sister
ship. Mr. Barney was in the tops studying the
Seamew a good deal through the glass that day,
too. I wondered if he was trying to see if his
brother was on deck.</p>

<p>For we did not run near enough to her that
day for figures to be descried very clearly either
on her deck or in her rigging.</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>In Which It Seems That a Prophecy Will Be
Fulfilled</i></p>
</div>

<p>We wallowed through the seas, but with
comparatively fair winds, for two days. The
Seamew would stand off on one tack, we on the
other; and by and by we would lose her below
the horizon; but, standing in, after some hours,
we found her again and were glad to see that she
had not pulled so very much ahead of us. But
it made Captain Joe awful fidgety, and he
certainly did keep the men hopping&mdash;reefing
and letting go the topsails, and working every
moment to gain a bit over his antagonist. Why,
we might as well have been sailing a crack yacht
for the America&#8217;s cup!</p>

<p>All this activity was very well during bad
weather; but the men began to get pretty sore
when the hard work continued throughout the
hours of fair days too. The Gullwing was, as I
have said, short-handed. The sea laws cover
such cases as this; but there are so many excuses
masters may give for going to sea without sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
hands to properly manage the ship that
it is almost impossible to get a conviction if
the case is carried to court.</p>

<p>Besides, it is the law that, if a case is not
proved against the master of a vessel, the men
bringing the suit must pay all the costs. Jack
Tar knows of something else to do with his small
pay without giving it to &#8220;landsharks of lawyers.&#8221;
That is why being a sailor and being a slave is
an interchangeable term. Many legislators,
having the welfare of seamen at heart, have
tried to amend the laws so that the sailor will
get at least an even break; but it seems impossible
to give him as fair a deal as the journeyman
tradesman in any other line of work obtains.</p>

<p>Old Captain Joe Bowditch, as decent a master
as he really was, had a streak of &#8220;cheese-paring&#8221;
in him that made him delight in saving on
the running expenses of his ship. Besides, he
probably knew his employers, Barney, Blakesley
&amp; Knight. Many a sea captain takes
chances, and runs risks, and sails in a rotten
ship with an insufficient crew, because he needs
to save his job, and if he doesn&#8217;t please his employers,
some other needy master will!</p>

<p>Although the Gullwing was so large a ship,
there are larger sailing vessels afloat, notably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
some engaged in the Atlantic sea-board trade,
and a fleet of Standard Oil ships that circumnavigate
the world. These are both five and six
masted vessels; but many of them are supplied
with steam winches, steam capstans, and various
other mechanical helps to the handling of the
sails and anchors. The Gullwing had merely a
donkey-engine amidships, by which the anchors
could be raised, one at a time, or to which the
pumps might be attached. The great sails on
her lower masts had to be raised by sheer bull
strength.</p>

<p>But in our watch old Tom Thornton was a
famous chantey-man, and the way we hauled
under the impetus of his rhythm, and the swing
of the chants (&#8220;shanties,&#8221; the sailor-man calls
them) would have surprised a landsman. I
learned that &#8220;a strong pull, a long pull, and a
pull altogether&#8221; would accomplish wonders.</p>

<p>We were now down in the regions where the
tide follows the growing and waning of the
moon exactly. Indeed, the great Antarctic
Basin, south of the Cape of Good Hope and
Cape Horn, is the only division of the seas where
the tide follows the moon with absolute regularity.
This is because the great sweep of water
here is uninterrupted by land.</p>

<p>The enormous wave, raised by the moon&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
attraction, courses around the world with nothing
to break it. Here in our northern hemisphere
immense masses of land interfere with the
coursing of this tidal wave; and the shallow seas
interfere, too. In the Mexican Gulf, for instance,
the tide seldom rises more than two feet,
while up along our north Atlantic shores it
often rises six and eight feet, while everybody
has heard of the awful tidal wave of the Bay of
Fundy.</p>

<p>The depth of the water, therefore, has much
to do with tidal irregularities. Out in the open
ocean, where the tide is abyssmal&mdash;that is, about
five thousand fathoms&mdash;the speed of the waves
is amazing. Where the depth decreases to five
fathoms the tide cannot travel more than fifteen
miles an hour. In England, for example, which
is surrounded by narrow land-broken seas, the
result is that they get some of the most terrible
and dangerous tidal races and currents to be
found anywhere on the globe.</p>

<p>In the South Seas&mdash;particularly at Tahiti&mdash;the
ebb and flow of the tide is perfectly adjusted.
It is always full tide at noonday and at
midnight, while at sunrise and sunset it is low
water. The rise and fall seldom exceeds two
feet; but once in six months a mighty sea comes
rolling in and, sweeping over the corral reefs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
nature&#8217;s breakwater, it bursts violently on the
shore. Indeed, sometimes this tidal wave inundates
entire islands.</p>

<p>In various parts of the world the tide creates
various natural phenomena. There is the
whirlpool between the islands of Jura and Scarba,
on the west coast of Scotland, known as the
&#8220;Cauldron of the Spotted Seas.&#8221; The Maelstrom
upon the coast of Norway is another
creation of the tide. The force of a heavy tidal
current pushing up a wide-mouthed river,
causes what is termed a &#8220;bore.&#8221; The most
striking example of this tidal feature is seen at
the mouth of the Amazon, where a moving wall
of water, thirty feet high and from bank to bank,
rushes inland from the ocean.</p>

<p>The waves raced by the Gullwing&#8217;s bulwarks
with dizzy speed. We plowed on, gaining all
we could in every reach, but noting likewise that
the Seamew, when she was in sight, seemed to
draw away from us. When we had beheld her
in the mirage she must have been a long way
behind.</p>

<p>I reckon Captain Bowditch prayed for foul
weather. And he did not have to pray long in
this latitude. We were in the district of the
Boiling Seas. Fogs are frequent; gales sweep
this section below the Horn almost continually&mdash;sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
from one direction, sometimes from
another. All the winds of heaven seem to meet
here and gambol together.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s runnin&#8217; us into trouble, that&#8217;s what he
ban doing,&#8221; croaked Stronson. &#8220;De old man, I
mean. He iss not satisfied with the fair wedder;
and who but a madt man vould crave for a gale
down here under de Horn?&#8221;</p>

<p>But we younger fellows laughed at the old
Swede. We were almost as much excited in the
race between the two windjammers as were
Captain Bowditch and Mr. Barney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember!&#8221; croaked Stronson. &#8220;The corpus
lights wass not for nottings. Trouble iss
coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not necessarily trouble to the ship,&#8221;
declared Tom Thornton. &#8220;Them St. Elmo&#8217;s
fires foreruns death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey ban mean bad luck, anyway,&#8221; growled
Stronson.</p>

<p>Thank and I listened to all this croaking with
a good deal of amusement. It surely never
entered my head that the prophecy of the old
men might be in anyway fulfilled.</p>

<p>And I certainly did not feel any foredoom of
peril myself. The expected gale came down.
We passed within sight of the islet named Cape
Horn, with a terrific wind blowing and the waves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
running half mast high. The Seamew had then
been dropped behind. Indeed, the last we saw
of her, she was wallowing in our very wake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme a breeze like this,&#8221; roared Captain
Joe from his station, to Mr. Gates and Mr.
Barney, &#8220;all the way to the time we take our
tug, and we&#8217;ll be eating supper in Baltimore
before that Seamew sights the Capes o&#8217; Virginia.&#8221;</p>

<p>But this, of course, was only brag. The
Seamew was not far behind us.</p>

<p>And then, that very night the prophecy of ill-luck
was fulfilled, at least insofar as it affected
me. Something broke loose and began to slat
in the tops. Mr. Gates, roaring through the
captain&#8217;s speaking trumpet, shouted for all
hands. We had barely got to sleep below, and I
reckon I was half way up the shrouds before I
got both eyes open.</p>

<p>It was a black night, with the wind coming in
strange, uneven puffs, and the deck all a-wash
with loose water. The ship was rolling till the
ends of her yardarms almost dipped in the leaping
waves.</p>

<p>My foot slipped; futilely I clutched at the
brace with the tips of my fingers. I knew I was
lost, and the shriek I uttered was answered by
Thank&#8217;s voice as I whirled downward:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>&#8220;Man overboard!&#8221;</p>

<p>I shot down, and down, and down&mdash;and then
struck the sea and kept on descending. I
thought of Mahomet&#8217;s coffin, hung between the
heavens and the earth. I was hung between the
ship&#8217;s keel and the bottom of the vast deep,
swinging in that coffin which can never rot&mdash;the
coffin of the ocean.</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>In Which I Pass Through Deep Waters</i></p>
</div>

<p>But I came to the surface after a time&mdash;and
with all my wits about me. I had need of them.</p>

<p>In these months that I had been knocking
about the seas I had been in peril often. Nor
was this the first time that death by drowning
had threatened me.</p>

<p>But on no former occasion had I been in so
desperate a strait. I know that in this rising
gale the Gullwing could neither be hove to, nor
could a boat be launched for me.</p>

<p>The schooner had gone on at the pace of a
fast steamship. And the tide was sweeping me
astern just as rapidly as the ship was sailing.
When I rose breast high on the first breaker I
saw the Gullwing&#8217;s twinkling lights so far ahead
that they seemed like candle flames.</p>

<p>I was alone&mdash;and this was one of the loneliest
seas upon all this great, round globe!</p>

<p>But when one is thrown into such a situation
of peril as I was then, his thoughts are so confused
that it is only afterward&mdash;if there <i>is</i> an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
afterward&mdash;that he analyzes his mental activities.
Just then I had only the clear desire to
live.</p>

<p>I turned on my back almost immediately and
letting my legs hang well down, floated easily
with my nostrils just out of water, and enjoyed
two or three minutes of very, very grateful repose.
I had been under the surface so long that
it was some time before I could breathe clear to
the bottom of my lungs again.</p>

<p>The buzzing in my head gradually died away.
I began to think collectedly. I did not waste
time thinking of rescue. At least, I could expect
no help from my comrades on the Gullwing.</p>

<p>When I took my headlong plunge from the
rigging I was clad in the heavy garb that most
deep-water seamen wear. I had on two thick
shirts, a heavy pea-jacket closely buttoned, and,
worse than all, boots to my hips. Sooner or
later all this weight of clothing would drag me
down.</p>

<p>I had paddled half a day at a time in Bolderhead
Bay; and even the fresh water ponds about
Darringford House, with their hidden springs
and under-tows, had never frightened me. I
was the first boy to go in swimming in the
spring and it had to be a pretty cold day in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
fall that drove me out of the water after the first
plunge.</p>

<p>Of course, this sea off the boisterous islet of
Cape Horn, was no warm bath. The chill of
it struck through to the marrow of my bones;
yet I believed I was good for several hours yet,
if I could get rid of those clothes.</p>

<p>Undressing under water was a trick I had tried
more than once; but it was those long-legged
boots that scared me. They already made my
lower limbs feel as heavy as lead.</p>

<p>Paddling with one hand I tore open my jacket
with the other, ripping the buttons off or through
the buttonholes as they pleased, and finally got
one shoulder and arm clear. As I was fumbling
to get the other arm out of the sleeve I felt the
handle of my knife.</p>

<p>The coat stuck to my left shoulder; but a
few slashes cleared me of the garment. It went
floating away on the tide.</p>

<p>I had bobbed up and down in this operation;
but was none the worse for the plunges under the
surface, being careful to breathe no water into
my lungs.</p>

<p>With the knife I slit both my shirts and tore
them off. But the boots were the problem
that shook me. I had to rest a bit before I
tackled them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>I doubled up in a sitting posture and made a
slash at one bootleg. Down I went&mdash;down,
down, until it was a fight to get up again&mdash;especially
with my fist closed upon my knife
handle. It was pretty hard work; every slash
meant a plunge under. It was slow.</p>

<p>I would draw up my left foot, for example,
paddle vigorously with my left hand, take a long
breath, make a slash with the knife in my right
hand&mdash;and start for the bottom of the sea!</p>

<p>But I got those boots off at last, though not
without suffering several cuts and slashes upon
my legs, which the salt seawater stung tremendously.
I had already gotten rid of my
belt, and my trousers came off easier. I was
sorry to lose some things in my pockets; but
was glad to think that my father&#8217;s chronometer
was hanging above my berth in the Gullwing&#8217;s
fo&#8217;castle and that what money I had was in the
keeping of Captain Bowditch.</p>

<p>And yet, it seemed utterly foolish to think of
escape from this predicament. I had heard
stories of wonderful rescues from drowning in
mid ocean; but why should <i>I</i> expect a miracle?
Here I was, struggling miles behind the Gullwing,
as naked as the day I was born.</p>

<p>Not many minutes had been spent in these
maneuvers, for all the time occupied in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
telling. For the Gullwing to have launched a
boat to hunt for me would have been ridiculous.
By day there might have been some chance of
their finding me before I sank for good; but in
the night&mdash;and a night as black as this&mdash;such
an attempt would endanger a boat&#8217;s crew for
nothing.</p>

<p>If they had flung me life-buoys, they would
have to come to me, for I could not see them.
Gazing up into the sky I saw that scurrying
clouds gave signs of a break in the weather.
Here and there a little lightening of the gloom
overhead showed the moon&#8217;s rays trying to
break through the mists.</p>

<p>Breast high again upon a rising wave, I took
one swift, whirling look all about. Dense
blackness everywhere on the face of the ocean;
but just as I sank back again the moon, breaking
through a rift, lighted up a silvery path before
me and at the end of that path&mdash;for an instant&mdash;I
believed I saw the glistening sails of the Gullwing!</p>

<p>It may have been a mirage&mdash;a vision. The
blackness shut down upon me, and upon the
sea again; but I fell back into the trough experiencing
a more sickening sense of desolation
than I had yet felt. It seemed to me as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
I had looked upon the last sign of human life
that I would ever see.</p>

<p>I suppose a more hopeless situation than mine
could scarcely be imagined. Yet I have philosophized
upon it much more since than I did at
the time. I would not let my mind picture the
natural end of this adventure. My mind rebounded
from the horrible thought that I was
lost. I would not contemplate it.</p>

<p>In the middle of this broad, tempestuous sea&mdash;naked&mdash;alone.
No hope of rescue by my companions
on the Gullwing, with not a splinter to
cling to, keeping from death only by constant
effort. Yet there was something inside me that
would not give up hope&mdash;that would not let my
muscles relax&mdash;that clung with a desperation
that clamped me to life!</p>

<p>But at first it was little exertion for me to
keep afloat. I was in first rate physical condition
and I was not afraid of sinking right
away. I knew how to handle myself.</p>

<p>I lay on my back with my head deep, my
mouth closed, only my nostrils above, conserved
the strength of my legs by letting them hang
deep, kept my arms outstretched, pretty well
down in the water, palms down, and paddled
gently, sometimes with both legs and arms, and
again only with my hands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>The waves rolled me over occasionally and
used me roughly; but I did not lose my head
and never sank to any depth, having always
plenty of air in my lungs. When I felt that my
arms might become wearied I folded them under
my head and kicked easily.</p>

<p>I am not sure that the sea subsided; but I
believe it must have done so. It was a providence
for me, then. I know that not many of
the waves broke over me, and I seemed sliding
up and down vast swells which heaved up out of
Nowhere, gray and green and foam-streaked,
and then disappeared and left me floating in the
deep trough.</p>

<p>If anyone was ever literally rocked in the
cradle of the deep, I was that person&mdash;from the
crest of the wave, down, down, in a gradually
diminishing rush, and then up and up to the
crest of the next roller&mdash;and so on, over and
over again.</p>

<p>Once I let my mind slip and began to calculate
the chances for and against my escape. The
conviction that it was impossible rushed over
me and I turned over quickly and struck out
with a savage, hand-over-hand stroke through
the waves, with the momentary insane feeling
that I must get somewhere!</p>

<p>The dogged idea of living as long as I could,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
however, came to me again with fatigue, and I
rolled over and rested, cradled in the waves.</p>

<p>My hand touched my knife, which still hung
by its lanyard from my neck. An awful thought
touched my mind, at the same moment. They
say it is an easy death, this drowning; but I
can imagine nothing more awful than to drift
for hours upon the surface of the sea with the
knowledge in one&#8217;s mind that, after all, there is
but one end possible. I opened my knife and
held it tightly gripped in my hand a moment.
Then I pulled the lanyard over my head and
let the knife and all drop into the depths&mdash;and
the curse went from me.</p>

<p>Four hours had I floated on the tumbling
sea, with the clouds above gradually breaking
and with the moon finally paleing under the
stronger light of the advancing sun. The blackness
disappeared. A wind-driven sky arched
the sea. And I lay looking up into heaven, waiting
for the end.</p>

<p>For I was in a sort of mesmerized state toward
the last, and kept myself afloat automatically.
It must have been so; by no other means can I
explain that I was still floating on the surface
when the sun arose.</p>

<p>The rocking motion of the swells soothed me
to a strange content that I can neither explain
nor talk about sanely. I remember I babbled
something or other over and over again; I was
talking to the moon riding so high there among
the rifted clouds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the night of July 14, 1886, the British ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Conqueror, fourteen days out from Liverpool,
bound for the lumber and fishing ports of the
Miramichi, in the Straits of Northumberland,
lost overboard Robert Johnson, A. B. The fact
is registered on the ship&#8217;s log. Three days after
the Conqueror reached Miramichi, the Bark
Adelaide, from Belfast, likewise came into port
and when she was warped into her berth beside
the Conqueror, the first man to step from the
Adelaide to the Conqueror&#8217;s deck was Bob
Johnson.</p>

<p>There are reasons for the sailor-men being
superstitious. The crew of the Conqueror would
not sail with Bob Johnson again. He was <i>fey</i>.
But really, he had only experienced a strange
and harsh adventure. The Adelaide, following
the unmarked wake of the Conqueror, had
picked him up after he had floated for some
hours.</p>

<p>And there are plenty of similar incidents in the
annals of those who go down to the sea in ships
to match this narrative of Bob Johnson.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The men who picked <i>me</i> up told me that I
shouted to them; but I do not remember it.
They were a crew of a boat put overboard by
the Seamew, and they brought me aboard and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
I lay in a bunk in the fo&#8217;castle all that day without
knowing where I was, or how I had been
snatched from an ocean grave.</p>

<p>About the first thing I remember clearly was
that a young man stood beside my berth and
looked down upon me with a rather quizzical
smile. I knew him at once and thought that I
must be in my old bunk aboard the Gullwing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;. Have I been sick, Mr. Barney?&#8221; I
asked, and was surprised to find my voice so
weak.</p>

<p>He seemed surprised for a moment, too, and
then I saw his face flush. He exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;By the great hornspoon! this fellow is off
the Gullwing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>was</i> off the Gullwing,&#8221; I whispered. &#8220;But
I guess this is no dream? I am aboard again
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No you&#8217;re not!&#8221; he declared, but he still
seemed bewildered.</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t the Gullwing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Seamew,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but&mdash;you&#8217;re Mr. Barney?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; he said, grimly. &#8220;But not the Mr.
Barney you know, young man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the mystery broke and I understood.
It was Mr. Alf Barney I was talking to, the
second mate of the Seamew.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>&#8220;Then&mdash;then you picked me up,&#8221; I murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we had an idea that you were a merman,&#8221;
he said, with a quick laugh. &#8220;Out here
in the ocean without a stitch of clothing on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I told him how I had got rid of my garments
after falling overboard from the other ship. The
men below gathered around to listen. They
were men of about the same class as manned the
Gullwing, I saw.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the luckiest fellow that ever drew
breath, I believe,&#8221; said the second mate, finally.
&#8220;You stay abed here till morning. Then you
can go forward and talk to the captain. It&#8217;s
almost unbelievable.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I scarce believed it myself&mdash;at least, not
while I was so lightheaded and weak. But being
a husky fellow my strength quickly came back
to me, and the care of the kind fellows in the
fo&#8217;castle set me on my pins the next day. I had
a brief interview with Captain Si Somes&mdash;a long,
cadaverous, hatchet-faced man who barked his
words at one as though he did not like to waste
either voice or words.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Cap&#8217;n Joe didn&#8217;t try to pick ye up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon he couldn&#8217;t. It was blowing pretty
hard just then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s like the old murderer,&#8221; he snapped.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t clew down his tops&#8217;ls quick enough of
course. He means to beat me if he kin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he won&#8217;t. We&#8217;ll pick him up if the
wind keeps this a-way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No chance of my getting back to her I
sp&#8217;ose?&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Gullwing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wa-al! I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to waste no time puttin&#8217;
you aboard. He&#8217;s short-handed anyway. He
allus is. I&#8217;ll feed ye for the sake of keepin&#8217;
ye,&#8221; and he cackled rather unpleasantly.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t like him as well as I did Captain
Bowditch. And my interest was centered in
the success of the Gullwing, too. I wanted to
get back to her and see her win the race.</p>

<p>I found the fo&#8217;castle hands of the Seamew just
as much interested in the rivalry of the two
ships as the Gullwing&#8217;s hands were. They believed
they were on the better craft, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, she sails a foot and a half to the Gullwing&#8217;s
one in fair weather,&#8221; one man told me.
&#8220;Wait till we get out of this latitude. You&#8217;ll
see something like sailing, then, when the Seamew
gits to going.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought she was sailing pretty fast just then,
and said so.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;If she ever struck another craft&mdash;or anything
drifting in the sea&mdash;she&#8217;d just about cut it
down with that sharp bow,&#8221; I observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t much danger of running into anything
down here. We ain&#8217;t seen another sail but the
Gullwing&mdash;save one&mdash;for a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We hadn&#8217;t spoken a vessel on the Gullwing
for a number of days,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Not many windjammers just now in
these waters. And all the steamers go through
the Straits,&#8221; my informant said. &#8220;But this
craft we spoke three days ago was a-wallowin&#8217;
along pretty well&mdash;and she had a tow, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A steamship, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. She was a two-stick schooner, but
she had a big auxiliary engine and was under
both steam and sail. The Sea Spell, she was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Sea Spell!&#8221; I cried, in surprise. &#8220;I
know her. I&#8217;ve been aboard her. Cap&#8217;n Tugg,
skipper and owner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the Yankee,&#8221; said my friend. &#8220;And
ain&#8217;t he a cleaner? What do you suppose he
had in tow?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was too amazed to answer, and the man
went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one cute Yankee, that Adoniram
Tugg. If there wasn&#8217;t but two dollars left in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
the world he&#8217;d have one in his pocket and a
mortgage on the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had to laugh at this description of the
master of the Sea Spell. And it hit off Adoniram
pretty well, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;That Yankee has made a killing this time,&#8221;
continued my informant. &#8220;He has been for
weeks cruising south of here, so he yelled across
to Cap&#8217;n Somes, hunting for an old whaler
stranded in the ice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Firebrand. I know about her. Indeed,
I&#8217;ve seen her,&#8221; I said, and told him the story of
my cruise on the Gypsey Girl and how we had
come across the frozen ship and I had boarded
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! don&#8217;t that beat cock-fighting!&#8221; ejaculated
the seaman, who was called Job Perkins.
&#8220;That old ile boiler was worth a mint of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it. They said she had fifty thousand
dollars in oil aboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if Adoniram Tugg makes port with her
he&#8217;ll turn a pretty penny. Salvage and all,&#8221;
ruminated Job.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; I gasped, suddenly
awakened to the fact that I was listening to a
mighty queer story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s what Tugg was tugging,&#8221; and
Job smote his knee and laughed at his own joke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;He was tugging <i>what</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I told you he had a ship in tow. She
was a sight, she was! Her masts were just
stumps; there wasn&#8217;t ten feet of her rail that
hadn&#8217;t carried away, and she was battered and
bruised and looked like she&#8217;d sink under the
surface every time a wave struck her.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that cute Yankee had broached oil
barrels on her deck, and she was just wallowin&#8217;
along in a pond of ile&mdash;a reg&#8217;lar slick. The
waves couldn&#8217;t break over her,&#8221; declared Job,
still laughing. &#8220;I reckon he&#8217;d patched up her
hull in some way, and it looked to me as though
he&#8217;d tow her into San Pedro, at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, man alive!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;What was she?
What was the Sea Spell towing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that Firebrand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And he&#8217;ll
make a mint of money out of her, as sure as
you&#8217;re a foot high.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XI</span></h2>


<p class="ph1"><i>In Which I See That There Is Tragedy in This
Ocean Race</i></p>
</div>

<p>I was dumfounded by this story of Job
Perkins. Later it was corroborated by the other
hands. It had really been Adoniram Tugg and
the Sea Spell that had sailed near enough to this
ship for conversation between the two skippers.
And the Sea Spell actually had that old whaleship
in tow.</p>

<p><i>This</i> was the astonishing part of it: The fact
that the Firebrand was not at the bottom of the
seas. I thought I had seen her rained upon by
ice&mdash;beaten down by the bursting berg&mdash;driven
under the leaping waves.</p>

<p>Yet, come to think of it, the rotating icefield
had turned so as to hide the frozen ship from us
aboard the Gypsey Girl when the ice split up,
and a curtain of ice-mist and leaping waves had
really hidden the spot where the Firebrand lay.</p>

<p>I had taken it for granted that the frozen
ship&mdash;more than a year and a half in the ice&mdash;had
found her grave right then and there. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
I remembered how sound the hulk of the whaleship
seemed when I went aboard of her. Only
her spars and upper works were wrecked. She
had collided with the ice and slid right out of the
sea at the collision. Perhaps the blow had
never made her leak a drop!</p>

<p>And then it smote upon my mind that the man
of mystery, Tugg&#8217;s partner, must be alive, too.</p>

<p>That stern, sturdy man with his gray beard
and hair, and his wonderfully sharp eyes, who
had stuck by the frozen ship when his mates
were driven off, and had battled against the gang
of sealers to preserve the treasure of oil from
their greed&mdash;this man in whose presence I had
felt a thrill not yet to be explained even in my
most serious times of thought. Why, Professor
Vose must be alive! There was no doubt of
that.</p>

<p>I could remember very distinctly our brief
interview upon the frozen ship. How quickly
he had disarmed me and showed me that he was
my master. I could imagine that he had not
given up hope even when the ice split up and the
Firebrand had slid back into the water amid the
crashing bergs and boiling sea.</p>

<p>Whoever this man was, he was a person of
marked character. He had impressed me deeply
and I felt that I could never really get him out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
my mind. Be he Jim Carver, the renegade
that had stolen money from the fish firm back
in Bolderhead, or Professor Vose, the marvelous
scientist that Tugg claimed him to be, the man
who had risked his life for the fortune of oil
aboard the Firebrand, was an individual whom
I should never forget.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t say that I was as pleased, as the hours
passed, with my situation aboard the Seamew as
I had been on her sister ship. In the first place,
I had no proper niche here. I was not one of the
crew. I was really an outsider&mdash;and from the
enemy&#8217;s camp at that.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a different spirit in this
crew. They spoke more bitterly of the Gullwing&#8217;s
company. They seemed to have no good
word for Captain Bowditch and Mate Gates,
and it was from Job Perkins that I finally got an
insight into the real significance of the rivalry
between the sister ships.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye wanter jump quick, young feller, when
Mr. Barney speaks,&#8221; Job advised me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. That is the way it is with <i>our</i>
Mr. Barney,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shucks! Jim Barney&#8217;s another sort of a man
from Alf Barney.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to the naked eye,&#8221; I responded, laughing.
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t tell &#8217;em apart.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you don&#8217;t know either of
them very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;I don&#8217;t know. I think I know our
Mr. Barney pretty well. He&#8217;s a smart second
officer and altogether a good fellow, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smart! Why, he&#8217;s a fool to his brother
Alfred,&#8221; declared Job. &#8220;They ain&#8217;t in the same
class&mdash;them boys. No, they ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I thought they were considered very
much alike,&#8221; I murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alf will show Jim, I reckon, how much better
he is,&#8221; and Job chuckled. &#8220;Ye see, they useter
be the best of friends, though brothers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; I cried.
&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t brothers ought to be the best of
friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never had a brother, had ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. For which I&#8217;m awfully sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had brothers. You needn&#8217;t be sorry,&#8221;
said Job, in his sneering way. &#8220;And I reckon
that is the way Alf Barney looks at it. Brothers
can be in your way, I tell ye. I found it so.
So does Alf Barney. Them boys is rivals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, so are Captain Si and Captain Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Them old tarriers!&#8221; snorted Job, very
disrespectfully. &#8220;They only play at fighting
each other. These Barney boys mean business.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>&#8220;But why?&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s something about their uncle. You
know, their uncle, old Jothan Barney, is senior
partner of the firm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s put &#8217;em into the business. Not
that he&#8217;s showed favoritism. No. These Barney
twins air good seamen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you will allow that,&#8221; I said, rather
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Jim is good; but Alf is a corker! a
crackajack!&#8221; chuckled Job. &#8220;They begun to be
rivals in a serious way previous to the v&#8217;yge
before last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye see, there ain&#8217;t but one rung at the top
o&#8217; any ladder. And there can&#8217;t but one man
stand at the top of a pyramid. When old
Jothan passes in his checks there will be just one
chance for a nephew to take his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that the two boys are jealous of
who will get the old man&#8217;s money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And stand in his place in the business,&#8221;
said Job. &#8220;Jothan isn&#8217;t one for dividing power.
He&#8217;s always been the cock o&#8217; the walk in the
firm. He&#8217;ll expect the nephew that takes his
place to be the boss. Can&#8217;t divide responsibility.
That is the way he looks at it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>&#8220;And a bad thing for the Barney boys,&#8221; I
muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he puts it to his nephews two years
ago,&#8221; continued Job Perkins. &#8220;He tells them
they&#8217;re running too even. He can&#8217;t tell which
is the best man. He don&#8217;t believe they are
just alike, even if they be twins.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You git up and dust, boys,&#8217; he said.
&#8216;One of ye do something different from the
other. Ye air jest of a pattern. I can&#8217;t tell
which is the man and which is his reflection in
the glass.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye understand, old Jothan didn&#8217;t know
which to put down in his will to be boss of his
money and the firm. The boys have got to
show him. He gives &#8217;em both the same chance,
but he expects one to beat the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Jothan begun before the mast. He
believes in the boys working out their salvation
aboard ship. And even so near a thing as these
two craft racin&#8217;, and one beating the other,
will tell in the favor of the second mate who&#8217;s
aboard the winning ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; I said to Job.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t hafter&mdash;only watch. Old Jothan
is getting tired of holding on to the business.
He wants to be shown who is the best man of the
two boys. That best one he&#8217;ll take into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
House after this voyage&mdash;and you mark my
word, sonny, that best man is going to be Mr.
Alf Barney.&#8221;</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t know whether Job had told me the
truth, or not; but I was sorry to learn of the
sordid rivalry between the two brothers. It
was tragic&mdash;no less; and I wondered what
would come of it in the end?</p>

<p>But my wildest imaginings would have been
tame indeed beside what really was to be the
outcome of the misunderstanding between Jim
and Alf Barney.</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>In Which the Captain&#8217;s Dog Goes Overboard</i></p>
</div>

<p>The heavy weather could not last forever;
we came to a comparatively calmer season of
several days. But the Gullwing was not sighted
and I began to be worried. So many things
might easily happen to her. The officers and
crew of the Seamew were interested in finding
the sister ship, too; but their comments upon
her absence were neither kindly nor cheering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she still ahead, or has she sunk?&#8221; demanded
Cap&#8217;n Si, after an examination of the
entire circle of sea through his glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet we&#8217;ve sailed clean around her,&#8221; said
the first mate, chuckling. &#8220;She&#8217;s in the discard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Cap&#8217;n Si. &#8220;It couldn&#8217;t be that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s reached land, then,&#8221; grinned the mate
pointing downward.</p>

<p>I thought that after all, both the crew and
officers of the Seamew were little like my friends
aboard the Gullwing. But we had such fitful
winds for a time and made so little speed, that
I reckon all hands were badly rasped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>We sighted several craft in these seas&mdash;all
windjammers; but none of them proved to be
our sister ship. We were now in the South
Atlantic, and had clawed well off from the
threatening rocks of Terra del Fuego. We had
passed from one great sea to another, and the
prow of the Seamew was turned northward.
She was headed for home in earnest.</p>

<p>The men and officers were decent enough to
me. I had been drafted into the mate&#8217;s watch
and I was smart at my duties and had learned
a deal aboard the Gullwing which came into
good play aboard her sister ship. But I wasn&#8217;t
happy.</p>

<p>The captain had a big Newfoundland dog
aboard&mdash;Major. He was the pet of the crew
and was a good fellow. Every day that it was
not too rough he went overboard for his bath&mdash;usually
in a sling made of an old sail, although in
these waters there was not so much danger of
sharks as in the more tropical seas.</p>

<p>However, there were other wicked marine
creatures&mdash;far more blood-thirsty than Mr.
Shark. And we had occasion to find this fact
out for ourselves within a few days of my coming
aboard the Seamew so strangely.</p>

<p>We had a morning when the sea was almost
calm. The wind scarcely gave the ship headway,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
and the canvas slatted and hung dead,
from time to time. We all &#8220;whistled for a
breeze.&#8221;</p>

<p>Along about the middle of the morning watch
a school of porpoises came into view. First we
saw them in a string to windward, and stories
of sea-serpents, told by both seamen and landsmen,
came to my mind. In the distance, following
one another with an undulating motion
through the short seas, the porpoises looked like
one enormously long creature&mdash;a huge serpent
indeed.</p>

<p>The porpoises struck a school of small fish
nearby and then there was fun. The big fish
sported all around the ship, rolling and bouncing
through the water in much excitement.</p>

<p>The Captain&#8217;s dog likewise grew excited. He
ran to the open rail and barked and yapped at
the sea-pigs; and I believe that one of the men
slyly &#8220;set him on&#8221; at the porpoises.</p>

<p>However, to the surprise of the watch on
deck (the captain was below), Major suddenly
leaped the rail and went plump into the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, there!&#8221; cried Job Perkins. &#8220;That dog&#8217;ll
git inter trouble; and then what will Cap&#8217;n Si
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>I fancy the surprise of the porpoises when
Major got among them was quite as great as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
amazement of the men on the deck of the slow
moving Seamew. The schooner was just slipping
through the sea, the short waves lapping
against her hull very gently. Major could
easily have kept up with us.</p>

<p>The porpoises were sailing around and around
the ship by this time, and the big dog bounced
among them, barking and biting&mdash;or trying to
bite&mdash;and otherwise acting like a mad dog. He
plunged first for one porpoise, then for another,
rising as lightly as a dog of cork on the waves,
and throwing himself about in great abandon.</p>

<p>He so excited the porpoises that they made a
general charge upon him. The dog beat a retreat
in a hurry; but the sea-pigs had their
&#8220;dander up&#8221; now and a score of them followed
him, jumping, snorting, and tumbling about,
evidently much delighted at putting the black
stranger to flight.</p>

<p>Major came towards the ship with a rush&mdash;his
only refuge. The men cheered him excitedly;
and the watch below was aroused and rushed
up to see what was going on. So did Captain
Somes appear, and the moment he saw the dog
with the big fish after him, he sang out for the
sling and scolded us unmercifully for letting
Major overboard.</p>

<p>I verily believe that the porpoises would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
torn the noble fellow to shreds in a very few
minutes. When Major came over the side, he
was cut in several places and one of his ears hung
from a thread or little more. I learned then
that, although the porpoise is such a playful
creature, and apparently harmless, it has means
of defending itself not to be sneered at!</p>

<p>I was leaning on the forward port rail, looking
idly across the stretch of comparatively quiet
sea (the porpoises having rushed away to lee&#8217;ard),
when I saw rising to the surface not many
furlongs from the ship&#8217;s side, a great brownish
mass that I took to be seaweed.</p>

<p>After a storm we often met fields of rock weed,
wrenched from the shallow banks underneath the
ocean by the terrific waves. This rising mass
was not much different&mdash;in first appearance&mdash;from
many weed-fields I had seen.</p>

<p>Mr. Alfred Barney was seldom on deck without
his fowling-piece&mdash;a beautiful, double-barreled
shotgun&mdash;in weather like this. He was a
splendid wing shot and seemed to delight in
bringing a gull flapping down into the sea, although
he never shot at albatross.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you looking at, Webb?&#8221; he demanded
of me, suddenly, coming around the corner of
the forward house, gun in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sir,&#8221; said I, just making up my mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
that I had made a mistake in my first diagnosis
of the nature of the brown mass that had now
risen to the surface, &#8220;why, sir, I believe it is
something alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That thing off there,&#8221; I replied, pointing to
the object that had attracted my attention.</p>

<p>He stepped to my side quickly and shaded his
eyes under the palm of his hand as he gazed at
the peculiar looking brown patch.</p>

<p>&#8220;A whale&#8217;s back?&#8221; I suggested, as he remained
silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. It hasn&#8217;t got slope enough,&#8221; replied
Mr. Alf Barney. &#8220;By George, though! it&#8217;s
alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I believed
it moved&mdash;there!&#8221;</p>

<p>A tremor of life seemed to seize the object
and passed all through it. Whatever it was, its
length was fifty or sixty feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s dying,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Some great
beast&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bat-fish,&#8221; he muttered, half raising his
rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. I don&#8217;t see either head or tail to
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It moved again&mdash;rather, it quivered. I can
scarcely express the feeling of horror and dislike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
for the thing that came over me. I shuddered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish it would go away,&#8221; I muttered.</p>

<p>Mr. Barney laughed, shortly. He raised his
gun again. Suddenly we heard a sharp, mandatory
voice behind us:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that, Mr. Barney!&#8221;</p>

<p>We both turned. It was the mate, Mr. Hollister.
He was a dark, stern, silent man, who
spoke to the men without much bustle, but who
evidently expected to be obeyed the first time.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a giant squid, Mr. Barney,&#8221; said the
mate. &#8220;He&#8217;s &#8216;bad medicine.&#8217; You don&#8217;t want
to fool with one of those fellows. I did so once
to my sorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>In Which I Learn a Deal About Sea Monsters in
General and the Giant Squid in Particular</i></p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;A squid of <i>that</i> size?&#8221; cried the young second
mate, doubtfully, while I gave my closer attention
to the long, dark brown body that lay
quivering upon the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s bigger,&#8221; said Mate Hollister, grimly.
&#8220;Ask any old Norwegian hardshell about the
&#8216;kraken.&#8217; I don&#8217;t mean the octopus; I mean
the real devil-fish&mdash;the squid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the octopus and the squid are two
different creatures,&#8221; said Barney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And that yonder is a squid&mdash;a devil-fish
of the largest size. There! you can see his
fore-arms now&mdash;look!&#8221;</p>

<p>I had observed something moving thirty feet
beyond one end of the bulky brown creature.
Two snake-like tentacles suddenly whipped out
of the water. They bore between their ends a
struggling fish. In a moment tentacles and fish
disappeared, apparently sucked in toward the
head of the monster.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>&#8220;Good-bye, Johnny Fish!&#8221; said Mr. Hollister,
grimly. &#8220;The parrot-beaks of that gentleman
have snapped him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had seen small squid. This beast lying on
the sea so near us was between fifty and sixty
feet long, with an average diameter of something
like five feet, and a ten-foot breadth of tail.</p>

<p>The squid are the natural food of the sperm
whale. Often the whale is so greedy for the
squid that it tackles one of these giants and
swallows the hard and indigestible beak which,
causing a disease in the cetacean&#8217;s stomach,
sometimes brings about the death of the gourmand.
As parts of squid beaks have been found
imbedded in masses of ambergris, scientists are
quite convinced that this gormandizing of the
sperm whale on squid is the immediate cause of
that secretion in its stomach which, strange as
it may seem, is the basis of many of the best
perfumes. Ambergris is a very valuable &#8220;by-product&#8221;
of the sperm whale.</p>

<p>The orca&mdash;that tiger of the sea&mdash;is inordinately
fond of the squid, too, as a diet. This
devil-fish, with its eight short arms, each
covered on the underside with innumberable
&#8220;suckers,&#8221; and its two fishing-arms which have
suckers only at the extremity, excites no fear
in the killer-whale.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>Concealed at the base of the squid&#8217;s ten arms is
the terrible beak, shaped like that of a hawk,
except that the upper jaw shuts into the lower.
This beak is likewise dark brown in color, almost
black at the tips, and is supported by
powerful muscles.</p>

<p>Years ago there was a huge squid captured at
Catalina, on the southern shore of Trinity Bay,
Newfoundland. This squid was bought by the
New York Aquarium and was the largest perfect
specimen of its kind ever examined by
scientists. Of course, they had to satisfy themselves
with a post-mortem examination!</p>

<p>The beak of this immense fish&mdash;which could
not have been much larger than the one we were
contemplating from the deck of the Seamew&mdash;was
as big as a six-gallon keg.</p>

<p>No animal can have a more formidable appearance,
or a more deadly grasp, than these
squid. It would seem as though the long, flexible,
muscular tentacles were a sufficient means
of defense and offense, without their being armed
with the terrible suction cups.</p>

<p>These cups have a serrated edge like a handsaw,
and are used for anchors as well as to secure
prey. They cling with the greatest tenacity, it
being easier to tear away an arm from the body
of the squid, than to force the beast to give up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
its hold. It has all the desperate nature of a
bulldog.</p>

<p>The beak, or jaw, is provided with terrible
teeth, and even the tongue is covered on the
upper part by a horny bed, bristling in the
center with a series of recurving teeth, while its
edge is armed with three other erect teeth,
which are slender and hooked. A man might
as well put his hand into a knitting machine and
expect to take it out unscarred, as to risk a hand
in the jaws of a squid. Those teeth tear the
creature&#8217;s food to shreds.</p>

<p>And one other characteristic the squid possesses
which gives it advantage over both enemy
and prey. When excited, and at will, it can
eject a substance like ink&mdash;indeed, it was used
by the ancients as ink&mdash;by which it clouds the
sea, and so often escapes an enemy. Its own
eyes being of a phosphorescent nature, it can see
well enough through the haze of this cloud of
ink, therefore its prey cannot escape. Besides,
its fishing-arms being three times the length of
its other tentacles, the squid can &#8220;fish a long
way from headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>This ink of the squid, or cuttle-fish, when
dried, is used in water-color painting, and is
known by the name of &#8220;sepia.&#8221; It is practically
indestructible.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>Now, all this by the way of introducing the
squid. The Seamew crept by the creature and
I, for one, was not sorry to see it finally disappear.
And from what the men told about the
cuttle-fish I judged that it would have been the
part of unwisdom for Mr. Barney to have fired
at the creature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lemme tell you,&#8221; said old Job Perkins, leaning
on the rail beside me. &#8220;Them ain&#8217;t critters
to fool with. I know. I been there and
learned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever get real close to a big squid,
Job?&#8221; I asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Big enough and near enough to suit me,&#8221;
he said, wagging his head and expectorating over
the rail. &#8220;I went up against a reef-squid once&mdash;in
the Galapagos, it was&mdash;and that was enough
for Job. Yes, sir!</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in the clipper ship Chelsea that time, I
was,&#8221; continued the old man, taking another
&#8220;chaw.&#8221; &#8220;Cap&#8217;n Daggett ordered a boat
ashore for turtles. He shot &#8217;em for soup and
fresh meat. Good eatin&#8217;, too. But I took a
seal-club with me, for I wanted a sea-lion&#8217;s skin
to make me a pair of moccasins, and I&#8217;d heard
&#8217;em roaring when we dropped anchor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went off by myself and waded around a
low, rocky point, in water not ha&#8217;f knee deep,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
but deep jest outside, when I saw Mr. Squid
moving along atop of the water. He made
considerable thrashing as he come along, like a
whirligig waterwheel; his body part looked
bigger than I am, and his arms two or three
times as long&mdash;at any rate, them two long arms
was tremendous.</p>

<p>&#8220;It headed into a little bay ahead of me,&#8221;
pursued Job, &#8220;and when it got into about three
foot of water it dropped anchor and began to feel
around with three or four of its arms. The
upperside of them arms were brown colored like
the rocks, with wrinkles and stiff bristles all
along the edge; the underside was white&mdash;sort
of a nasty, yallerish, dead-looking white&mdash;with
suckers like saucers in two rows. What I took
to be the head had something like eyes; but I
couldn&#8217;t make &#8217;em out plain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye know how it is when ye see a snake, when
you&#8217;re walking on shore,&#8221; said old Job. &#8220;Ye
always want to try and kill it. That&#8217;s the way I
felt about that squid. I didn&#8217;t think of any
danger when I waded to it, but it seemed to be
watchin&#8217; me, for it squared round, head-on. I
hit it a clip with my iron-bound seal-club, when,
quick as a thought, it took a turn around the
club with one o&#8217; them short suckers, and held
on. I pulled my blessedest, but the critter was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
too much for me. Then&#8217;s when I&#8217;d oughter
backed out.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I was obstinate and I kept tugging at
the club. Just then it showed its head&mdash;it shot
out from the knob in front, a brown-and-purple
spotted thing with the eyes showing. And in a
second one of its arms was around me. It
wound around my bare leg and another shot
around my neck. The suckers took hold like a
doctor&#8217;s cups.</p>

<p>&#8220;It began to heave and haul on me. You kin
guess I pulled and hollered. I got out my knife
and hacked at it, but it would have mastered me&mdash;it
sure would!&mdash;if Cap&#8217;n Daggett hadn&#8217;t
come running along the shore and fired both
barrels of his gun into its head. Then it let go
and slid back into deep water, squirting its
nasty ink all about.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t never fooled with no squid again,&#8221;
concluded Job Perkins. &#8220;They ain&#8217;t no pets.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was later in that day, when I was standing
my trick on lookout, and the Seamew had got a
better wind and was forging ahead at a spanking
pace, that Mr. Hollister and Mr. Barney
stood near me and I heard the second mate ask
the older man about the experience <i>he</i> had had
with a giant squid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Hollister, &#8220;when I was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
young fellow I ran against one of those squids,
and I never want to bother with another one. I
was mate of a little schooner&mdash;the Pearl, she
was&mdash;150 tons and a crew of six men forward,
with the cook. We were bound from the
Mauritius to Rangoon in ballast, to return with
paddy, and had put in at Galle for water. Three
days out we fell becalmed in the bay&mdash;about
latitude 8 degrees 50 minutes North, longitude
84 degrees 5 minutes East.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the 10th of May about five o&#8217;clock in the
afternoon&mdash;eight bells, I know, had gone some
time before&mdash;we sighted a two masted screw
steamer on our port quarter, about five or six
miles off. Very soon after, as we lay motionless
on a sea like glass, a great mass rose slowly to
the surface about half a mile on our larboard side,
and remained spread out, as it were, and
stationary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even at that distance I could see that it was
fully as long as the Pearl, and I sung out to the
skipper to ask what he thought it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Blest if I know,&#8217; says he. &#8216;Barring its size,
color and shape, it might be a whale. Some
deep-sea critter, sure enough,&#8217; and he dove below
and came up with a heavy rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;The crew was discussing it, too, and as the
skipper was preparing to fire at the thing, Bill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
Darling, a Newfoundlander, exclaimed, putting
up his hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Have a care, Skipper. That ere is a squid
and it&#8217;ll capsize ye if ye hurt him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d heard of squid, and seen squid,&#8221; proceeded
Mr. Hollister, &#8220;and so had the skipper.
But we both laughed at old Bill. The skipper
up with his gun and let her go. He hit the thing,
and it shook all over; there was a great ripple
all around him and he began to move.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Out with all your axes and knives!&#8217; shouted
Bill, &#8216;and cut at any part of him that comes
aboard.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old fellow taking the deck in that way
made the skipper mad, and I was some surprised
myself. You know how old sailors are&mdash;superstitious,
as Negroes were in slavery. We
couldn&#8217;t do anything to move the schooner, of
course, and the skipper and I didn&#8217;t say a thing
to the crew. Bill and the two others got axes
and one other a rusty cutlass. We were all looking
over the side at the advancing monster; but
I for one, didn&#8217;t believe it was dangerous.</p>

<p>&#8220;We could now see a huge, oblong mass,
moving by jerks, just under the surface of the
water, and an enormous train following. The
oblong body was at least half the size of the Pearl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
and just as thick. The wake, or trail, might
have been a hundred feet long.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the time I&#8217;ve taken to tell you,&#8221; said Mr.
Hollister, &#8220;the brute struck us and the ship
quivered under the thud; I wasn&#8217;t scared a mite
until then. The skipper gave a yell and plugged
away with his rifle another time. And then
monstrous arms like trees seized the vessel and
she keeled over; in another second the monster
was aboard, squeezing its great polypus bulk in
between the two masts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill screamed, &#8216;Slash for your lives!&#8217; But
all our slashing and yelling didn&#8217;t do a mite of
good. Holding on by his arms, the monster
slipped back into the sea again, and dragged
the vessel down with him on her beam-ends.</p>

<p>&#8220;The skipper and I were thrown into the
water. I caught sight of old Bill and one of the
others squashed up betwixt the mast and one of
them arms. It was an awful sight, I tell you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, the Pearl&#8217;s hatches were open and
in a few moments she filled and went down.
Those two went with her. The rest of us escaped
the brute&#8217;s tentacles and a boat from the
Strathowen&mdash;the steamer we&#8217;d seen&mdash;picked us
up a little later.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the finish of the Pearl and two
brave men,&#8221; added Mr. Hollister, gravely.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
&#8220;And she isn&#8217;t the only craft that&#8217;s been carried
down by a giant squid. Most folks I&#8217;ve told it
to think it&#8217;s a sailor&#8217;s yarn. But the crew and
the passengers of the Strathowen could swear
to it&mdash;and did so, too. The story was printed
in the Indian papers when we reached Madras.
And you&#8217;ve seen one of the beasts yourself, to-day,
and know to what an enormous size they
grow. There are dangerous monsters in the
sea, Mr. Barney; but I reckon there&#8217;s nothing
worse than a healthy, full-grown devil-fish.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XIV</span></h2>


<p class="ph1"><i>In Which a Signal Retards the Race</i></p>
</div>

<p>It was at six bells in the morning watch of the
next day that the lookout in the top sang out
the wailing cry:</p>

<p>&#8220;On deck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crow&#8217;s nest, ahoy!&#8221; responded Mr. Hollister,
who had the deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sail-oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two points off the weather bow. Four-sticker!
It&#8217;s that blessed Gullwing, by Jiminy
Christmas!&#8221; responded the sharp-eyed seaman
aloft.</p>

<p>There was as much excitement aboard the
Seamew now as though this was the first time
her sister ship had been spied in the offing. We
ran up the shrouds to see her better, and the
officers were all on deck with their glasses.</p>

<p>She came snorting up to us on the starboard
tack, all her bright canvas bellying, and so trim
and taut that it was a pleasure to gaze upon her.
I felt a thrill of delight as I watched the Gullwing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Aboard of her was my chum, Thankful
Polk, and my other friends, and I wished with
all my heart that I might rejoin them.</p>

<p>But I knew very well that under the present
circumstances that would be impossible. Had
the two schooners been becalmed the day before,
side by side, I might have got Cap&#8217;n Si to
put me aboard the Gullwing.</p>

<p>But one thing I did beg the captain of the
Seamew to do, and, after some little demur, he
agreed to it. He ordered Mr. Barney to bring
out the signal flags, kept in the chest amidships,
and instructed him to inform Captain Bowditch
that the Seamew had picked up, alive, the lost
member of his crew.</p>

<p>This signaling was not done until the Gullwing
was so near that both ships were about to tack.
As soon as the line of flags was run up on the
Seamew, they hustled about on the Gullwing
and replied. Nor did Captain Bowditch shift
his helm at once. The sister ships continued to
approach each other.</p>

<p>The Seamew had plainly overtaken the Gullwing,
and now, when she sheered off, she would
begin to creep ahead of the craft in which I was
the more interested. With the wind as it was,
and nothing untoward occurring, the Seamew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
was bound to gain something over her rival in
each leg she made.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he sayin&#8217;?&#8221; bawled Cap&#8217;n Si to Mr.
Barney.</p>

<p>I had already learned something about the
signal code, and when the second mate&#8217;s back
was turned I got a squint at the codebook.
Captain Bowditch was asking if the Seamew
would heave to and send me aboard!</p>

<p>&#8220;Cap&#8217;n Joe is sure cracked!&#8221; cackled the commander
of the Seamew. &#8220;Tell him I wouldn&#8217;t
do it for a hull barrel of greening apples.&#8221;</p>

<p>I reckon Mr. Barney put the refusal more
briefly. But the Gullwing continued to hang
in the wind while another line of flags was run
up to her fore. The book told me that the
signal read: &#8220;I&#8217;ll send boat aboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No he won&#8217;t, by jinks!&#8221; crowed Cap&#8217;n Si.
&#8220;Nor he wouldn&#8217;t wanter do it if he warn&#8217;t so
blamed short-handed. Stow your flags, Mr.
Barney. Stand by. Ready! haul sheet!&#8221; and
he went ahead and gave swift orders to put the
Seamew about on the other tack.</p>

<p>But I was glad that those aboard the Gullwing
knew that I was alive. I could imagine Thank&#8217;s
relief, and how surprised and&mdash;I hoped&mdash;glad,
the others would be to know that I had not
found my grave in the ocean. I even thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
kindly of Bob Promise, the bully, and believed
that he was likewise thinking kindly of me at
that moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;And to serve Cap&#8217;n Si out for not being willing
to meet Cap&#8217;n Joe half way, and let them
take me aboard,&#8221; I muttered to myself, &#8220;I hope
the Gullwing beats the Seamew all to flinders!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Seamew, however, gained slowly upon her
sister ship. On every tack that day she made a
better showing. Sometimes the Gullwing was
below the horizon; but whenever we sighted her
she was dropping back a bit. The wind remained
steady and from a favorable quarter
and by and by the night dropped down and
divided the two ships more effectually than the
sea itself.</p>

<p>As the light faded upon sea and sky we sailed
under a vast, black-velvet canopy embroidered
upon which were the countless stars and planets.
Constellations that I knew nothing about glowed
from the depths of the firmament; and brighter
than all was the Southern Cross. The moon
had dipped below the horizon and therefore the
Cross and the stars were the more brilliant. I
paced the deck alone and thought of my mother,
and wondered what she was doing just then, and
if Chester Downes was still trying to circumvent
me, and Mr. Hounsditch, and gain control of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
the fortune, possession of which he so much
begrudged my mother and myself.</p>

<p>And a thought came to me from out the stillness
and immensity of that night&mdash;a thought
that forever after seemed to haunt me; was there
not some curse upon my grandfather&#8217;s huge
property, which had been willed my mother and
I under such wicked conditions? For that
Grandfather Darringford&#8217;s will had been inspired
by hatred of Dr. Webb, my father, one could not
doubt.</p>

<p>Had my father not been drowned as he was
off White Rock, that will of grandfather&#8217;s would
have been the source of heartburnings in the
family. Human nature is human nature; the
time would have come when the fact that Dr.
Webb was a stumbling-block to his son&#8217;s advancement,
or his wife&#8217;s ease, would have been
advanced. That is, if my father had remained
all these years a poor man. And what else
could he have been with his practice in Bolderhead?</p>

<p>Men get stunted in small towns&mdash;especially
professional men. Dr. Webb could never have
made much more than a miserably poor living
for mother and I had he lived; and all that
time the thought of the great Darringford Estate
would have been the skeleton in our closet!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>It was better as it was, I suppose. It had
been a dream that my father was still alive. I
believe I would have gladly given up my share
of my grandfather&#8217;s money to have found that
the mysterious man aboard the frozen ship was
my father! I had been strangely drawn toward
that man.</p>

<p>Besides, I felt now as though I were old enough
and big enough to make my own way in the
world, and to keep my mother in comfort, if not
in luxury, as well.</p>

<p>Dawn drew near and the stars began to fade.
Soon the deck would be a-bustle with our watch
washing down. We had probably crossed and
recrossed the way of the Gullwing during the
night, but she had not been hailed from the
lookout.</p>

<p>As the light of day advanced the wind fell.
We hardly made steerage-way in the pearl-colored
light of dawn. The coming day is
heralded ashore by hundreds of feathered trumpeters;
but here on the open sea it advances with
silence.</p>

<p>Far, far out on the sea, where the gently
swelling water seemed buttoned to the rim of the
sky, a sudden flush appeared. The hue lay
upon both sky and sea&mdash;indeed, it was hard to
distinguish for a bit the one element from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
other. But I knew the sun was about to poke
his head up just there!</p>

<p>And as the glow grew, a ghostly figure drew
across the pink patch. I watched it eagerly.
The sun, mist-shrouded and sleepy, was thrust
out of the sea; and across the red face of him
sailed a four-stick ship&mdash;the Gullwing! It did
not need the man in the crow&#8217;s nest to hail the
officer of the deck and announce the fact. I
could identify our sister ship from where I
stood.</p>

<p>Long red rays like pointing fingers played
across the sea. The Gullwing and the Seamew
were several miles apart. The early rays of the
sun touched an object on the sea&mdash;at first merely
a black spot&mdash;lying about equi-distant of the
two ships.</p>

<p>When I first saw this black thing I sprang
into the shrouds. Mr. Hollister hailed me:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you see, Webb?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something adrift&mdash;yonder, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lookout, ahoy!&#8221; bawled the mate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir! I sees it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye make it out to be?&#8221; demanded
the mate.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the black hulk of an open boat,&#8221; I cried,
as the seaman above hesitated. I expect the
rising sun half blinded him. &#8220;There&#8217;s a stump<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
of a mast and she seems decked over forward&mdash;no!
it&#8217;s an awning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A ship&#8217;s boat?&#8221; cried the mate, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir!&#8221; came down the voice of the
man in the top. &#8220;That&#8217;s what she be. And
wrecked. Not a sign of life aboard her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it, Webb?&#8221; Mr. Hollister repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see nothing moving,&#8221; I admitted, slowly.</p>

<p>Mr. Hollister sent down for his glass, and then
joined me in the shrouds. The deck was all
a-bustle by now. Cap&#8217;n Si came up, rubbing
his eyes and yawning.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with all you lubbers?&#8221;
was his pleasant demand. &#8220;What&#8217;s that&mdash;the
Gullwing? Ain&#8217;t you never seen her before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop your eyes a bit, Captain,&#8221; advised
Mr. Hollister, swinging down after a look
through his glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; exclaimed the skipper. &#8220;A boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Empty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks so,&#8221; replied Mr. Hollister, and
passed him the glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t wuth picking up,&#8221; decided Cap&#8217;n Si,
after a long look at the drifting boat.</p>

<p>He closed the glass. Mr. Hollister waved me
down and turned to order the watch to work,
when the man in the tops hailed again. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
in a better position to see into the drifting boat
than anybody else.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see something moving in that boat, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you see?&#8221; bawled Cap&#8217;n Si.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something fluttering&mdash;a flag, or a rag.
There it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>There were light airs stirring. Suddenly
something upon the broken mast moved. A
flaw of wind fluttered something fastened there.
Was it a signal of distress? Was some poor
creature adrift in the half wrecked boat?</p>

<p>I wondered what Cap&#8217;n Si would do. To
ignore a flag of distress&mdash;to pass by the opportunity
of rescuing a fellow-creature from
death&mdash;would be an awful thing. Yet there
might be nobody in the boat. I could see the
old man doubted.</p>

<p>And then the lookout hailed again:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Gullwing&#8217;s dropping a boat, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough!&#8221; roared Cap&#8217;n Si, all in a
bluster at once. &#8220;I won&#8217;t let Cap&#8217;n Joe do
more&#8217;n me. Mr. Barney!&#8221; The second mate
had followed him on deck. &#8220;Call away a boat&#8217;s
crew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir!&#8221; was the second mate&#8217;s smart
response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beat the Gullwing&#8217;s boat to that barge.
Understand me? You git there first. I ain&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
goin&#8217; to let Joe Bowditch crow over me in Baltimore.
Mebbe the boat&#8217;s wuth savin&#8217; after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he had ceased speaking Mr. Barney
had shouted down the fo&#8217;castle hatchway and
his watch tumbled up. I had slid down the
stays to the deck and was right beside the boat
Mr. Barney had elected to launch. I wanted
to go in that boat, but I belonged to the mate&#8217;s
watch and knew I would not be selected.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XV</span></h2>


<p class="ph1"><i>In Which We Have a Good Race In Earnest</i></p>
</div>

<p>And I had an idea that if I asked the captain
to go in the boat, or suggested it to Mr. Barney,
I&#8217;d get an immediate refusal. I had a decided
belief that Captain Somes didn&#8217;t wish me to
get aboard the Gullwing again. Not that he
needed my services particularly&mdash;although my
work was costing him nothing but my grub and
the cast-off clothes I had been given; but
Captain Si feared that Captain Joe needed me,
and my remaining with the Seamew was crippling
his rival. Which, by the way, was likely
to be the facts in the case.</p>

<p>So, with this scheme in my mind, I expect I
was even more cautious than was necessary. I
might have been unnoticed had I jumped right
into the boat as it went overboard.</p>

<p>But when I heard Mr. Barney call off the
men&#8217;s names, I noted that Job Perkins was
among the chosen. I had sized up Job for what
he was. I grabbed him as he passed me on the
run and shot into his ear:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;Listen! ten dollars when we reach Baltimore
if you&#8217;ll let me take your place in the boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; said Job, wonderstruck for a moment.
But it was only for a moment. The
old fellow had all his wits about him and in
working order.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bargain, boy,&#8221; he whispered, and the
next moment he fell sprawling over a coil of
rope and scrambled up again right before Mr.
Barney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo! what&#8217;s the matter with you, old
man?&#8221; demanded the second officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ow-ouch!&#8221; groaned Job, rubbing his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurt you?&#8221; snapped Mr. Barney.</p>

<p>&#8220;By gravey! I <i>did</i> wrench my arm,&#8221; groaned
Job, his face writhing with an expression of
pain.</p>

<p>I stepped in at once. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take his place,
sir,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; cried the officer, without a glance,
and I slid down the falls and seized the bow oar.</p>

<p>In another moment the officer followed me,
getting into the stern, and we cast off.</p>

<p>&#8220;You git that boat for me, Mr. Barney!&#8221;
bawled Cap&#8217;n Si, over our heads. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
let them fellers from the Gullwing beat ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do our best,&#8221; responded Mr. Barney,
waving his hand. Then to us he said: &#8220;Give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
way, men! See what you can do. Bend the
ash!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before we had left the deck of the Seamew we
knew that the Gullwing&#8217;s boat was off ahead of
us. It looked as though the drifting boat was
about as far from one vessel as she was from the
other. The air being so light, we would have
lost time trying to beat down to the spot. The
race was between the six-oared boats, and I do
not believe any college regatta was ever pulled
amid more intense excitement.</p>

<p>At first, however, as we were so low in the
water, we could not see our rival. Nor could we
scarcely observe the object of our race.</p>

<p>But over these gentle waves we could pull a
mighty stroke, and I found that the men with
me at the oars were practiced hands. The
strokeman set a pace that made us bend our
backs in good earnest. This was a race!</p>

<p>Mr. Barney was using a steering oar, and using
it well. He stood up to the work, and therefore
he could see much farther than we at the oars.
By glancing now and then over my left shoulder,
however, I could see the black hulk of the drifting
boat rising and falling upon the gentle
waves.</p>

<p>And at first I saw nothing about the boat to
express life saving the fluttering rag. It was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
flag. After some minutes of hard pulling it
was revealed to us that it was a British flag, set
union down.</p>

<p>As I pulled I saw that Mr. Barney was looking
across at some other object than the mysterious
black craft. His eyes were squinted up as he
gazed into the rising sun, and the expression of
his face was mighty grim.</p>

<p>&#8220;He sees the Gullwing&#8217;s boat,&#8221; I thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull, you fellows!&#8221; he suddenly barked at
us. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you pull?&#8221;</p>

<p>And we <i>were</i> pulling. I could stand the pace
for a bit longer, I thought; but the stroke was
certainly bending his back and driving his oar
with a vigor that left little more to be expected
from mortal man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull!&#8221; yelled our mate. &#8220;Pull, or those
lubbers will beat you to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no feathering of oars, or any fancy
work. This was just the hard, deep pull of the
deep-sea oarsman. We breathed heavily; the
sweat poured from our limbs; we neither spoke
nor looked back over our shoulders now. We
became veritable pieces of mechanism, set to do
this certain stroke, and to do it until we broke
down completely!</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep it up! Break your backs!&#8221; yelled the
second mate.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>I had an idea that there was an added incentive
for Mr. Barney&#8217;s excitement. His twin
brother more than likely commanded the boat
from the Gullwing. But we at the oars could
not see her yet.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer we came to the drifting
boat. Our craft sprang through the sea at the
end of every stroke. Had one of the oars broken
I believe we would have been capsized.</p>

<p>Once more I glanced around. Not a sign of
life in that floating mystery with its signal
floating from the broken mast. But there <i>was</i>
a bit of canvas spread forward of that mast, like
an awning.</p>

<p>Mr. Barney saw me look back and he swore
at me good and plenty.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want us to lose this race, you sawney!&#8221;
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>I was convinced that, for his part, he was
more anxious to beat the Gullwing&#8217;s crew&mdash;and
incidentally his brother&mdash;than to save any life
there might be remaining on the wreck.</p>

<p>But perhaps I misjudged Mr. Alfred Barney.
We were all excited. Even I, who had no
reason for wishing to see the Seamew&#8217;s boat
win, pulled my oar with every last ounce of
strength I possessed. Mr. Barney had accused
me without warrant of trying to throw the race.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>The two racing boats were not head-on to each
other, but were approaching the wreck at an
angle that now brought each in sight of the
other. When the Gullwing&#8217;s boat flashed into
the range of my eyes I saw half a dozen of the
men I knew. There was Thankful Polk, heaven
bless him, and Mr. Jim Barney at the steering
oar. The sight of them made me feel good all
over.</p>

<p>But I could not see the wreck now without
twisting my head around. And if I did that I
knew I should bring the wrath of our second
mate upon me. The Gullwings cheered. For a
moment I did not know what for. Could they
be winning?</p>

<p>And then Thank&#8217;s jolly voice reached me
across the stretch of sea:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurray, Clint! Go it, old boy! You&#8217;re a
sight for sore eyes!&#8221;</p>

<p>But I had no breath with which to answer.
And I reckon if he had been pulling his oar as
I was, he would not have been so boisterous.</p>

<p>The strain of the last few minutes of the race
was terrific. My breath came in great sobs, and
I heard the other men with me groan as they
strained at the heavy oars. We were about all in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull, you tarriers!&#8221; barked Mr. Alf Barney
again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>&#8220;Keep it up, boys!&#8221; yelled Mr. Jim Barney
in the other boat.</p>

<p>I saw scowling looks exchanged between the
twin brothers. It must be true, as Job Perkins
had said, the two Barney boys were deadly
enemies!</p>

<p>Then suddenly our cox shouted: &#8220;In oars!
Way all!&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt the nose of the boat bump something
behind me. I dropped my oar and turned to
seize the broken gunwale of the drifting hulk we
had pulled so hard to reach. We of the Seamew
had won the race.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XVI</span></h2>


<p class="ph1"><i>In Which I Return to the Gullwing&mdash;and With
My Arms Full</i></p>
</div>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t breath enough left at first to answer
Thankful Polk&#8217;s hail. And when my eyes fell
upon the contents of the drifting boat that we
had pulled so far to reach, what I saw was not
calculated to aid me to easy breathing. Lying
upon his back, face upwards, in the glare of the
morning sun, lay a man, bareheaded and barefooted,
dead.</p>

<p>And such an awful death as he must have
died! His face was quite black, although he
was a white man by nature, it was as though
the blood had been congested in his face. His
tongue had protruded slightly from between his
firm, white teeth. His legs were drawn up as
though in a convulsion and the corpse had stiffened
that way. His limbs had not been composed
by any kindly hand after the spirit had
left its body.</p>

<p>He was a sailor. There was tattooing on his
chest and arms. He had a short, bushy beard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
I believed at first glance that he was a British
seaman. And almost at this first moment of
glancing into the boat I made another discovery.
I learned how the man had died.</p>

<p>His tongue was not black; and although he
was much emaciated, neither thirst nor hunger
had hounded the sailor to his dreadful end.</p>

<p>He wore a gully slung by a lanyard around his
neck. That knife was twisted tightly in the
cord, and the cord itself was imbedded in the
flesh of the dead man&#8217;s throat. Actually a
tournequet had been made of the knife and cord,
and the sailor had been strangled. He was a
horrid sight, as he lay with his feet to the empty
stern and his touseled head thrown back over a
seat.</p>

<p>Perhaps many of the details of this awful
scene were a matter of later observation; but
it seems to me now as though everything about
the dead man was photographed upon my brain
at the first glance.</p>

<p>And then my gaze roved beyond him. There
was a piece of sailcloth laid across the bow of
the open boat beyond the stump of the mast. It
was dark under that awning. But right at the
entrance lay something white and gold.</p>

<p>Without waiting for any order from Mr.
Barney, I stood up and leaped into the half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
wrecked boat. I heard none of the other men
speak a word. All my attention was given to the
object which my dazzled eyes now rested upon.</p>

<p>A young girl&mdash;the prettiest, most appealing
child I had ever seen&mdash;lay under the awning.
Her head was toward me. Her face was as
white as milk, and the blue veins showed plainly
at her temples and were traced along her throat.
Her cheeks were without an iota of color.</p>

<p>She was all white&mdash;her face, her thin, ruffled
dress&mdash;the bare arm from which the sleeve had
been pushed back to her elbow. All white,
save the great mass of her hair. That was gold&mdash;pure
gold. Such a beautiful child I had never
imagined before. She was twelve or thirteen
years old.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you got there, Webb?&#8221; I heard
Mr. Alf Barney shout.</p>

<p>I had dropped on my knees beside the unconscious
girl. I saw that she was only delicate and
exhausted. There was a breaker of water lashed
to the gunwale right beside her, and a cup with
water in it. I saw no food; but I knew well
enough that the girl was not dying of thirst.
No more than the sailor had died of thirst!</p>

<p>I gathered the girl up in my arms. She was a
light weight. I thought she sighed and her
eyelids fluttered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>And then suddenly sounded a raucous bellow,
in a strange tongue, from within the decked-over
portion of the boat. Something moved. I
leaped back and almost trod upon the dead man.</p>

<p>Out from under the awning crept a tall, lean,
lithe brown man, dressed in torn sailor togs, but
with a dirty turban around his head. He was a
wild-eyed, yelling fiend. In a moment there
flashed out of his dress, from some secret place,
a long, glittering blade. With this raised above
his head he bounded in his bare feet the length
of the boat after me.</p>

<p>At that moment the boat from the Gullwing
scraped alongside the wreck. As I whirled to
escape this murderer, this boat was nearest to
me. Thankful Polk, his red face transfixed
with horror, shouted to me:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Sharp! Quick! This way!&#8221;</p>

<p>Their boat was really nearest me. I leaped
into it. Thank shoved off with his oar and the
boat and the wreck were separated by a growing
streak of sea.</p>

<p>The men in both boats all talked at once; and
the two Mr. Barneys shouted; but above all
the uproar I could hear the frenzied shrieks of
the brown man in the turban.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back, here, Webb!&#8221; cried the second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
officer in the Seamew&#8217;s boat. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take that
child with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Clint!&#8221; commanded Mr. Jim
Barney, quietly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have us swamped.&#8221;</p>

<p>I obeyed him quickly. Thank smote me a
hearty blow between the shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sharp! you&#8217;re a daisy! I knowed they
couldn&#8217;t never drown you,&#8221; he declared.</p>

<p>But I couldn&#8217;t reply to him. I still held the
girl in my arms. There seemed to be no good
place there in the stern to lay her down. And
she was so frail, and soft, and pretty! I had
never seen such a delicate creature before.</p>

<p>We were still moving from the wreck and the
Seamew&#8217;s boat, the men backing water. There
was a splash and a louder yell from the Seamew&#8217;s
men. I glanced over my shoulder. I could see
the turbanned head of the wild man and his thin,
bare arms beating the water. He was swimming
desperately after our boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;That monkey&#8217;ll be drowned,&#8221; Thank cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;We kin get away from him easy,&#8221; said another
of the rowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be drowned,&#8221; I said to Mr. Barney.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to take him in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s so, Webb,&#8221; said the second
mate. &#8220;The Seamew is welcome to the old
tub&mdash;and the dead man.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>The brown man came to the side of our boat,
panting and moaning. He was near spent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he belongs to this girl and he thinks
we&#8217;re running off with her,&#8221; said Mr. Barney.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s crazy as he can be,&#8221; said Thank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help him in. See that he doesn&#8217;t have that
knife. If he doesn&#8217;t behave, we can lash his
wrists together,&#8221; said Mr. Barney.</p>

<p>The foreign looking man was hauled in. He
lay panting on the bottom, between Mr. Barney
and I. We were being hailed from the other
boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let that Webb come back with us, you fellows!&#8221;
cried Mr. Alf Barney. &#8220;Cap&#8217;n Si will be
furious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He belongs to the Gullwing,&#8221; said our Mr.
Barney, promptly. &#8220;You can&#8217;t have him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See about it, then,&#8221; said the officer, shortly.
Then to his own crew he said: &#8220;Give way,
men! Altogether, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>We swept away on a graceful curve and
headed for the Gullwing. Mr. Barney nodded
to me with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly had a close call for your life,
Clint,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Luck was with you when
you went overboard from the Gullwing, after
all. Everybody gave you up for lost&mdash;save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
Thank there. He swore that if you went to the
bottom you could walk ashore, somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment the brown man drew a longer
breath and struggled to his knees. Mr. Barney
reached forward to seize him; but I saw that
the foreigner&#8217;s eyes glowed no longer with the
wild light that had made him look so savage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sahib,&#8221; he said softly, &#8220;is Her Innocence
safe? Is the Missee unharmed? Is it well with
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked down at the child&#8217;s face. She was
breathing quietly, but her eyes were still closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is asleep. She does not seem to be
harmed,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sahib! I was overcome. I had watched so
long. Two long weeks have we been in that
boat. Water we had, but little food. That
food I had brought myself for Missee. One
man become touched of the finger of the gods and
leaped overboard. The other desired the fragments
of food which only remained for Her
Innocence. I felt myself fast losing the thread
of life. Then&mdash;the other man died.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew what he meant. I understood how
that man had been strangled by the lanyard
around his neck that the food might be saved
for the girl. I guess this strange man was
pretty nearly a savage; but I believed then&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
I believe now&mdash;that he had done right.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;Dao Singh&mdash;then fell asleep, Sahib. I
believed it was to be my last sleep. But the
Missee had her food and the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; I said, for he spoke only to me, even
ignoring Mr. Barney. &#8220;Now you will both be
saved. Our ship is at hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well, Sahib,&#8221; he sighed. &#8220;Dao Singh&mdash;is
the Sahib&#8217;s&mdash;servant&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He fell back into the bottom of the boat and
his eyes closed. I feared he had died then and
there; but Mr. Barney bent over him, opened
his shirt, felt of his heart, and then nodded to
me with encouragement.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s asleep,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just done up&mdash;plucky
brown devil. A Hindoo, I take it.
These folks were from a British ship; but that
boat had no name on her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour later we pulled under the Gullwing&#8217;s
rail. All hands were there to eagerly
welcome us. We caught the falls and they
hauled us up to the davits, heavy as the boatload
was.</p>

<p>As we swung inboard I leaped down to the
deck, still bearing the unconscious girl in my
arms.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XVII</span></h2>


<p class="ph1"><i>In Which We Learn the Particulars of the Wreck
of the Galland</i></p>
</div>

<p>Captain Joe Bowditch smiled down broadly at
me from the poop as I leaped to the deck; but
when he saw the burden in my arms his countenance
changed queerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the name o&#8217; goodness you got
there?&#8221; he barked.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little girl, Captain Bowditch,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little&mdash;well! what d&#8217;ye think o&#8217; that?&#8221;
he gasped, waddling down the ladder. &#8220;Ye
didn&#8217;t git that aboard the Seamew? Nor out o&#8217;
the ocean when ye went overboard, neither?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Mr. Barney, who had followed
me. &#8220;She is what we found in that drifting
boat&mdash;part of what we found, at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A gal! Moses ter Moses, and all hands
around!&#8221; groaned the captain. &#8220;Whatever will
we do with a gal aboard the Gullwing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how we could have left her there,
Captain,&#8221; laughed Mr. Barney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t ye cackle!&#8221; snapped the old man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you leave her for Cap&#8217;n Si? He&#8217;s
a man that&#8217;s more used to female children than
I be. Why, Cap&#8217;n Si&#8217;s sister married a man
whose brother got spliced to a widder woman
that had twin gal babies. He&#8217;s more fitten to
take such a responsibility than what I be.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked as though he thought he had proved
his case, too. But I was too much worried over
the condition of the pretty creature in my arms
to pay much attention to his growling.</p>

<p>And when the Hindoo was brought inboard,
Captain Joe went off into another fit. &#8220;Holy
smoke!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Another useless critter to
feed. Didn&#8217;t you leave nothin&#8217; in that boat for
the Seamew?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We left a dead man,&#8221; chuckled one of the
men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;we could have buried him easy,&#8221;
grunted the old man. &#8220;Take that nigger below
and find out what seems to be the matter with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But his bark was a whole lot worse than his
bite. He hurried away to open the spare cabin
for the girl, and I followed him into the afterhouse,
still bearing her in my arms.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates, who had the deck, came to look
down upon her pretty, white face as I started
below.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;Bless her!&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Have a care
with her, Clint. Glad to see you again, boy.
Ah! that pretty one ought to bring us luck, sure
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come right this way, boy, and lay her in the
bed,&#8221; ordered Captain Bowditch. &#8220;My! she
looks bad&mdash;but pretty! Sh! is she asleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then the trembling lids, with their long
golden lashes, opened slowly. With her complexion
and hair, I had expected to look into
blue eyes. But I was astonished to find that
the little creature&#8217;s orbs were a beautiful, deep,
deep brown, with golden sparks in their depths.
My face was so close to hers at the moment her
lids parted that I could see the reflection of my
own countenance in the pupils.</p>

<p>&#8220;My soul!&#8221; murmured Captain Joe, looking
over my shoulder, &#8220;she&#8217;s jest the prettiest thing
I ever see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her wan face changed slowly. A faint color
was breathed over it. She gazed steadily into
my countenance, and it was evident that I did
not frighten her. She put up one hand and
touched my cheek. I tell you, the touch thrilled
me!</p>

<p>Then her eyes closed again, she sank deeper
into the pillow, and was again asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, boy!&#8221; croaked the master of the Gullwing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
trying to speak softly. &#8220;You run and
tell the doctor to kill a chicken and make some
broth&mdash;strong broth, now. Don&#8217;t want no
&#8216;phantom soup&#8217;&mdash;suthin&#8217; that tastes like a
chicken did more than wade through a gallon of
water on stilts. If he don&#8217;t make it good I&#8217;ll
be in his wool!&#8221;</p>

<p>I ran to do his bidding. I knew very well
that the little girl would have the very best of
everything there was upon the big schooner.</p>

<p>In the dog-watch I held a regular reception.
The men were eager to hear the story of my adventure
overboard, and old Tom Thornton declared
I might live to be &#8220;a second Methuserlum&#8221;
and never experience a closer call than
that. Old Stronson shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;De poy iss fey,&#8221; he muttered, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s sure a lucky youngster,&#8221; declared Bob
Promise. &#8220;No wonder he got the best of me
when we had our set-to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thank and I had much to talk over. I know
my chum had suffered in spirit when it seemed
that I was drowned. He never would admit
to the others that he had given up hope of seeing
me again. Now he clung close around me and
did not seem to want to let me out of his sight&mdash;not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
even long enough for me to go down to take
a look at Dao Singh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let that Jasper be, Sharp,&#8221; Thank drawled.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t kill a nigger easy&mdash;sleep won&#8217;t hurt
him. If he was pretty near two weeks on watch
in that boat, no wonder he&#8217;s all in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a faithful creature,&#8221; I said. &#8220;And he
must love his mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That Jasper&#8217;s taken a fancy to you, too,&#8221;
Thank said. &#8220;You&#8217;re &#8216;it&#8217; with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not realize at the time how very right
Thank was, and what it meant to be canyonized
by Dao Singh.</p>

<p>The report came forward that the little girl
had taken some of the broth the cook had made,
was seemingly satisfied with her surroundings,
and had gone to sleep again. Mr. Barney told
me that Cap&#8217;n Bowditch was peeking in at her
every hour or so, and that it was plain the old
man was prepared to get down on the deck
and let his little visitor walk on him&mdash;if she so
desired.</p>

<p>But in the morning watch they called me and
I found that the girl wanted to go up on deck,
but had asked to be lifted by the boy who had
taken her from the wrecked boat. She remembered
me, then! And I had not really supposed
she had seen me until after I had lain her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
down in the berth and she had opened her eyes.</p>

<p>She had had some breakfast. There was a
little flush in her face. She looked much
brighter, and when she saw me she smiled delightfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know your face!&#8221; she said, and although her
voice was weak, it was as sweet as a tinkling
silver bell. &#8220;I was sure I could not be mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistaken?&#8221; I asked, puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. You were the boy I saw before&mdash;oh,
long, long before I came here.&#8221;</p>

<p>That puzzled me, and I suppose my face must
have shown my surprise. She laughed&mdash;a pretty,
resonant chime. I fell for that voice of hers!</p>

<p>And then what she said about seeing me so
long before got me going, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, you never saw me before I got you out
of that boat,&#8221; I declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I did,&#8221; she returned, confidently.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been aboard this big ship long, have
I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only since yesterday,&#8221; I admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what the nice captain told me,&#8221; she
returned, as though satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve seen me just once before.
When I brought you below yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you took me out of the boat?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And held me all the time we were getting
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; she breathed, smiling up into my
face again. &#8220;I knew it couldn&#8217;t be all just a
dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain had fixed a chair himself, with
blankets and the like, in the shade of the afterhouse.
There I laid her down and then, having
no further orders, would have gone forward to
my own place. But she clung to my hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sit down here on the deck beside me,
tell me your name, and all about you,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;For although I saw you so long ago, I never
learned who you were.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked up at Mr. Gates and the Captain and
slyly tapped my forehead. I believed she was
lightheaded. The old man nodded and said,
gruffly enough, for he was deeply moved:</p>

<p>&#8220;You stay with her, Clint. Do jest what she
wants ye to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clint?&#8221; she repeated, questioningly. &#8220;Is
that your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clinton Webb,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clinton is pretty. You are English?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;American.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>&#8220;Oh, yes! I am an English girl; but I have
lived in British India most all my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, Miss,&#8221; I said, knowing that the
captain and mate were dying to hear her story.
&#8220;You tell us all about it. How did you come in
that boat? And what vessel was it that was
wrecked?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We sailed in the Galland, a big steamship,
from Calcutta,&#8221; said the girl softly. &#8220;I was
with friends. They were taking me home&mdash;&#8216;home&#8217;
means England to all British India
people who are white.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you were going to relatives?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know. I am not sure. My father
had some people&mdash;<i>once</i>. But they treated him
unkindly, I believe. He had not heard from
them for years. My father was Captain Erskin
Duane. He died very, very suddenly. My
mother had been a long time dead,&#8221; and the
tears now began to fill her eyes and creep down
her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends who were about to go to England
took me on the Galland with them. These
were Mr. Suffix, and Mr. and Mrs. Traine, and
Cecelia Traverstone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were they saved?&#8221; asked Mr. Gates, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know. I think not. I think the
steamer&#8217;s boilers blew up and smashed most of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
the boats and liferafts, so that few were saved,&#8221;
said the girl, simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor child!&#8221; breathed Captain Bowditch,
blowing his nose right afterward like a
fog siren.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Phillis Duane,&#8221; she said, after a moment.
&#8220;I traveled with my <i>ayer</i> and Dao
Singh, who would not leave me when father
died. He had always served the captain. We
lived up country from Calcutta. I do not think
that my father was very well acquainted with
the people I sailed with, after all. I was alone,
and they were just kind to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t know what you were going to
do when you reached England&mdash;whom you
would meet?&#8221; queried Mr. Gates, gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. It was all in the hands of my friends,&#8221;
she said, shaking her head. &#8220;And I am quite
sure they never got away from the Galland. I
would not, had it not been for Dao Singh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That nigger, eh?&#8221; grunted the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a Hindoo. He is a very intelligent
man in his own language and among his own
people. I have heard my father say so. I fear
he sacrificed his caste by attending on the
captain&mdash;and on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he saved you from the wreck?&#8221; I urged,
keeping her to the story of the wreck.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>&#8220;Yes. When the boilers blew up (the steamship
had been afire all night) Dao Singh ran
into the cabin and hurried my <i>ayer</i> and me out
on the deck. Some men were lowering a boat.
It was damaged some.</p>

<p>&#8220;Singh tried to put the <i>ayer</i> and me in it.
But I believe she must have fallen overboard,
or been pushed overboard. There was much
confusion. I was scared and cried. When I
understood a little better about matters, we
were in the boat, drifting without oars, and the
Galland, all a mass of flames, seemed to be going
down, stern-foremost, under the sea.&#8221;</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XVIII</span></h2>


<p class="ph1"><i>In Which I Become Better Acquainted With
Phillis Duane</i></p>
</div>

<p>There was little more to be learned, it seemed,
about the actual tragedy of the burned steamship.
How the fire had been started she could
not say. She had been asleep. Her nurse, or
<i>ayer</i> awoke her at the height of the stampede of
passengers for the deck. Whether the officers
and bulk of the crew had been killed by the
explosion, or had abandoned the ship and her
human freight, she did not know.</p>

<p>The Galland had been some months on the
voyage, having circumnavigated the world, when
Phillis Duane and her friends boarded her at
Calcutta. She had touched at Chinese ports,
and again at Tahiti. She was a British tramp
steamship and Phillis seemed to think that her
home port was Edinburgh. It might be that
the lost girl&#8217;s friends were Scotch, and that the
friends she traveled with were likewise Scotch,
and that is why they had selected the ill-fated
Galland to get home on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>&#8220;Do you suppose that nigger knows?&#8221; demanded
Captain Bowditch, of Mr. Gates, in a
whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtful if you get anything out of him,&#8221;
returned the mate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Understands English, doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221; growled
the skipper.</p>

<p>&#8220;And speaks it. But these Hindoo servants
don&#8217;t really know anything about the English
sahibs they serve. The Britisher governs India
in a boiled shirt and evening clothes. He is
about as human to the natives as one of their
own cast-iron gods. That&#8217;s how Johnny Bull
has been able to boss the several million of
blood-thirsty inhabitants of his colonies. No.
The nigger wouldn&#8217;t be likely to know anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why did he follow the girl to wait on her,
then, Mr. Gates?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he&#8217;s a nigger&mdash;an inferior tribe.
That&#8217;s the nature of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not believe it. I had never read that
the people of Hindoostan were particularly inferior
to the whites. And Dao Singh looked to
me as though he knew a whole lot more than the
ordinary European. I was mistaken if he was
not the best educated person aboard the Gullwing
at that moment!</p>

<p>But it might be that the Hindoo knew nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
of the cause of the wreck and of what had become
of her other passengers and the crew.
Unless some other boats had been picked up from
the lost Galland, her case was likely to be another
of those unexplained tragedies of the deep
which fill the columns of our newspapers for a
few issues and then are forgotten&mdash;so easily
forgotten!</p>

<p>The officers and I had held the brief conversation
noted above when we had withdrawn out of
earshot of the little girl. The cook had brought,
her a beaten egg to drink as a &#8220;pick-me-up&#8221;
between breakfast and dinner. When she had
finished it she looked around for me again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, boy,&#8221; said the captain. &#8220;Keep her
amused. Poor little thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And encourage her to talk with you, Clint,&#8221;
advised Mr. Gates. &#8220;Put what she says down
in your log. If you do that, you may gradually
get together a connected story of what and who
she is. Such information will be valuable in
aiding her to find her friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought well of that idea, and promised to
do so; though I wondered how the mate knew I
kept a log. I had taken notes of my adventures
ever since I had been blown out to sea on my
little sloop, the Wavecrest; but at this time I
did not know what an aid to memory a log&mdash;or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
diary&mdash;would be. By the way, a seaman never
calls it &#8220;logbook;&#8221; the daybook of a ship at
sea is merely a &#8220;log.&#8221; One of the most popular
magazines published has a correspondence department
called &#8220;The Logbook,&#8221; and that
makes the sailor smile!</p>

<p>I had no objection to being attentive to our
little passenger. I judged her to be a mighty
plucky little girl. Of course, her father had
been dead long enough for the first of her grief
to have been assuaged before she had sailed
from India. And the friends she had sailed
with had won her heart; therefore she had not
loved them enough to miss them much now.</p>

<p>She had endured privations in the drifting
boat remarkably well. She told me of the man
that had gone crazy and leaped overboard. She
did not seem to know that the men aboard the
boat with her had had no food. I began to
have a remarkably high opinion of Dao Singh.
Yet I knew very well that he had strangled the
man I had found dead in the boat and had been
unable to throw the heavy body overboard.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a vast difference between the negro
race and the Hindoo, I thought, remembering
Mr. Gates&#8217; words, &#8220;This Dao Singh is a remarkable
man, or <i>I</i> am much mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Barney came along and spoke to the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
one, and she seemed to like him&mdash;as I had&mdash;at
first sight. Afterward the young second mate
talked a little in private with me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Robbins says she takes to you and is
willing to talk with you, Webb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re trying to draw out from her her
history?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good idea. There may be some difficulty
in getting trace of her friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she sha&#8217;n&#8217;t suffer, if her friends don&#8217;t
turn up,&#8221; I said, with emphasis. &#8220;My mother is
rich and she will be glad to take Phillis herself,
I have no doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good thing, too,&#8221; said Mr. Barney,
heartily. &#8220;But you understand, my lad, that
there may be friends expecting the girl in the
Old Country, that she knows nothing about.
We shall have to report the case to the British
consul at Baltimore, and he will look up her
folks&mdash;if she has any. In case there should be
none, somebody might have to step in to save
the child from being sent to an institution&mdash;in
England, I presume. They would scarcely send
her back to India.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much, sir!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;They will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
have to show pretty good grounds for taking
her from mother&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you don&#8217;t know whether your mother
will take her or not,&#8221; laughed Mr. Barney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes she will,&#8221; I assured him. &#8220;She&#8217;d love
to have a girl like Phillis.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I had no fear on that score. Mother
couldn&#8217;t help but fall in love with such a dear
little thing as Phillis Duane. I was glad to see
that Phillis seemed fond of me, too. I had
never had a sister, and it struck me just then
that a sister was what I had missed all my life!</p>

<p>We were getting on fine together and she was
chattering to me just as though she had known
me for years, when I spied a figure coming
waveringly down the deck from the forward
house.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s poor Dao Singh!&#8221; exclaimed Phillis.
And then she called to him in her sweet voice;
but what she said none of us could understand
as it was in his own tongue.</p>

<p>He glided rather than walked along the deck.
Somehow he had obtained clean garments; and
he had washed his turban. Altogether he looked
very neat and trim. But he was very weak and
cadaverous. That Hindoo had come pretty
near starving to death, and no mistake.</p>

<p>When he had spoken to the girl in reply, bowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
low before her, he turned quickly to me. I
was not only astonished, but I felt mighty foolish
when he dropped gracefully on his knees and
touched the deck lightly with his forehead right
at my feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dao Singh is the servant of Webb Sahib,&#8221;
he said, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the love of Mike, get up!&#8221; I gasped, and
I heard Thankful Polk giggling behind me, while
Mr. Barney laughed outright. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
want to kneel to <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Singh arose and stood, with dignity, before
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Webb Sahib has but to command,&#8221; he said,
quietly. &#8220;He is the friend and protector of
Her Innocence,&#8221; indicating Phillis with a
scarcely perceptible gesture. &#8220;His word is law
to Dao Singh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, if that is so,&#8221; I said, glad that he
had spoken too low for anybody else to hear.
&#8220;If my word&#8217;s law, just you treat me with a
little less deference. I&#8217;m only a man before
the mast on this ship, and it won&#8217;t do to be
kowtowing to me and treating me as you do the
Memsahib. That&#8217;s all right for <i>her</i>, Dao Singh;
but I&#8217;m not used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is as the Sahib pleases,&#8221; he replied,
gravely. &#8220;He has but to command.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>I began to wonder if a Hindoo, who was so
enthusiastically my friend, might not prove to
be something of a nuisance in the end!</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>In Which I Learn Something More About the
Barney Twins</i></p>
</div>

<p>The captain allowed Singh to wait upon his
&#8220;Missee&#8221; to his heart&#8217;s content, and I heard
the two mates laughing over the fact that the
Hindoo insisted upon acting as steward and
waiting upon the Captain Sahib at table. The
Old Man wasn&#8217;t used to having a man standing
behind his chair at meals and it near took his
appetite away at first. But Phillis being in the
cabin and soon taking her meals at the first
table, pleased the officers immensely, I could see.</p>

<p>Forward, Singh was forever trying to do little
things for me, and learning that I thought a good
deal of Thankful Polk, the Hindoo included my
chum in his voluntary services. He looked over
our clothes and mended them, and insisted upon
doing our washing.</p>

<p>&#8220;That Jasper is just as handy as any house-broke
nigger I ever saw,&#8221; declared Thank.
&#8220;My folks owned slaves before the war; but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
don&#8217;t know but being waited on by one is going
to be too rich for my blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thank saw no difference between a Hindoo
and a Negro; anything off color was a &#8220;Jasper&#8221;
to him. But it tickled him when Singh called
him &#8220;Polk Sahib.&#8221; With the other hands he
was never familiar; but nobody save Bob
Promise treated him unkindly. Bob was a
bully, and that mean streak in him was bound
to show on the surface every once in awhile.</p>

<p>Meantime the old Gullwing was snoring away
up the coast of South America. Not that the
land was in sight, for we were miles and miles off
shore; but the course she followed was parallel
to the coast. The Seamew was not sighted for
days at a stretch, and we did not know whether
she was ahead of us or astern. I had an idea,
however, that during the favorable weather she
was walking away from us at a pretty lively gait.</p>

<p>Since I had returned from my sojourn aboard
the Seamew I thought that Mr. Barney treated
me differently. That is, when we were off duty
and chance threw us together. Before my accident
I had put on the gloves with him on several
occasions, and he had been kind enough to say
that I was as good a sparring partner as he had
ever had. We took up this exercise again, as
the weather remained so favorable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>He was curious about the attitude of the
Seamew&#8217;s company toward us, and whether
they were as eager to win the race to Baltimore
as were the men aboard the Gullwing.</p>

<p>&#8220;More so,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;They mean to beat
us if they can&mdash;from Cap&#8217;n Somes all down the
line.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw off the gloves and said, with a side
glance at me:</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <i>sir</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as eager as the others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as eager, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent a moment, as I got into my shirt,
and then he shot at me:</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you think of my brother, Alf
Webb?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was rather taken aback for a moment. Then
I saw that he expected a straight answer and I
did not like to say that I did not like Mr. Alf
as well as I did him. So I stammered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I thought there was something troubling
Mr. Alfred&#8217;s mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye?&#8221; returned Mr. Barney, cocking his
eye. &#8220;There&#8217;s something troubling both our
minds, I reckon.&#8221; And then, after a moment&#8217;s
silence, he asked: &#8220;Will the Seamew beat us,
Webb?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>&#8220;I hope not!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;But the spirit
among the crew of the Seamew is different from
ours. Cap&#8217;n Somes would take any advantage
he could to beat us; so would Mr. Hollister
and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And my brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I am afraid so. That is the way it impressed
me,&#8221; I admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alf didn&#8217;t use to be like that,&#8221; said Mr.
Barney, gravely. &#8220;But he and I have been at
outs for some time. It&#8217;s a bad, bad affair,&#8221; he
added, more to himself than to me. &#8220;And it&#8217;s
Uncle Jothan&#8217;s fault. Confound that old man,
anyway!&#8221; he completed, with a good deal of
emphasis.</p>

<p>Then it was just as Job Perkins had told me!
The rivalry between the Barney twins was
fostered by their rich uncle. I had no comment
to make&mdash;it wasn&#8217;t my place. But Mr. Barney
seemed to wish to talk to somebody, and perhaps
because I was so near his own age (he could not
have been twenty-three yet) and came from
people who were more like his own class, he
warmed toward me for the moment. Perhaps,
too, I am a sympathetic listener.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alf and I,&#8221; said Mr. Barney, thoughtfully,
&#8220;have always been more than brothers. We&#8217;ve
been <i>friends</i>. There&#8217;s a difference. We understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
each other fully&mdash;or always have until
now. I never had any other chum, nor did he.
We have been just as close to each other all our
lives as the day we were born.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we had to be,&#8221; he added, thoughtfully.
&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t anybody else for us to
get close to. Our mother died soon after we
were born. Father was lost in that old leaky
bucket belonging to the firm, the Timothy K.&mdash;named
after T. K. Knight, who used to be head
of Barney, Blakesley &amp; Knight before Uncle
Jothan worked up in the firm.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s what makes the old man so crazy
now. He wants a Barney to take his place so
that another Knight won&#8217;t boss things. He&#8217;s
nutty on it&mdash;that&#8217;s what he is!</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Jothan has had the care of us since
we were small, you see. It&#8217;s nothing to his
credit, however. Father left some property&mdash;sufficient
to give Alf and me our education and
set us out into the world with a little something
to rattle in our pants&#8217; pockets besides a bunch of
keys!</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Uncle Jothan tried to set us boys at
each other long ago. He tried his best to set
one off against the other&mdash;to make Alf sore on
me, or me sore on Alf. We didn&#8217;t see what he
was getting at, at first.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>&#8220;But he didn&#8217;t succeed very well. He made
his favor, and his money, and his influence an
object for us to struggle for. As it happened,
we just wouldn&#8217;t struggle. We would not be
rivals. What one had, t&#8217;other had. And that
satisfied us&mdash;until last year,&#8221; and Mr. Barney
shook his head dolefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we got our tickets the old man was
crazy to find out if one of us passed better than
another. We were about equal, I reckon.
What one knows about seamanship, the other
knows. In navigation I&#8217;m sure we stood equal.</p>

<p>&#8220;That didn&#8217;t satisfy Uncle Jothan. The
last day we saw Baltimore he had us to breakfast
with him. He was more ornery that morning
than ever before.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You two boys make me sick!&#8217; he said to us.
&#8216;I believe you try your blamedest to keep even
in everything.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And what if we do?&#8217; I asked him. &#8216;Ain&#8217;t
that as it should be? We&#8217;re twins.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;re a pair of twin fools,&#8217; says he, with
his usual politeness. &#8216;One of you don&#8217;t know
which side of his slice of bread the butter&#8217;s on.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I looked at mine. &#8216;The top side,&#8217; I says,
&#8216;so far,&#8217; and Alf laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And you&#8217;ll find it butter side down, if
you don&#8217;t have a care,&#8217; snarled Uncle Jothan.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
&#8216;I got about tired of waiting for one of you to
show some sense. I tell you there&#8217;s only room
for one of you in the firm, and that one is going
to handle my money. The other is going to be
a poor man all his life.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Which one&#8217;s going to be poor, and which
one rich?&#8217; Alf asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You might as well tell us which will be
rich, Uncle,&#8217; I said, laughing. &#8216;For if it&#8217;s Alf,
then I can begin to borrow from him right now.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s right,&#8217; says Brother Alf. &#8216;What&#8217;s
mine is yours.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;That really made the old man mad, I expect.
He pretty near gnashed his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I believe I&#8217;ve got a pair of totally condemned
fools for nephews!&#8217; he yelled, only he
put it even stronger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he was mad! I saw that we&#8217;d gone too
far with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Never mind, Uncle,&#8217; I said, soothingly.
&#8216;We&#8217;ll both do our best for you&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And your &#8220;best&#8221; will be just exactly
alike,&#8217; he cried. &#8216;When you get your mate&#8217;s
tickets it will be the same, and in the end I&#8217;ll
have a couple of masters of windjammers as
near alike as old Somes and Bowditch. What
one can do the other can do. Ye stood just the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
same in your books at school, and you stand
just the same in your rating at sea.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect the old man was pretty well heated
up. But we just laughed as though it was a
joke.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I tell you what,&#8217; says he, pushing back his
chair. &#8216;You sha&#8217;n&#8217;t fool me no more. One of
you is going to take his place in the firm at the
end of this v&#8217;yge you are beginning. One of
you will win and the other will lose. And I&#8217;ll
never let a penny of my money get into the
hands of the fellow that loses.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he was quite in earnest, we could see.
Alf looked at me and shook his head. It was
past laughing at.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Gullwing and the Seamew,&#8217; says uncle,
&#8216;are putting to sea on the same day. They will
practically make the same voyage. Now listen
to me! Whichever of you boys steps ashore at
Baltimore at the end of the voyage, that boy will
be my heir, and the other sha&#8217;n&#8217;t have a cent.
Now, that&#8217;s final. One of you has got to win,
whether you want to, or not. I&#8217;ll settle it
myself.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And with that he walked off and left us, too
mad to even bid us good-bye,&#8221; said Mr. Barney.</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>In Which Phillis Tells Me of Her Dream</i></p>
</div>

<p>I thought Mr. Barney had finished his story,
he was so long silent. I saw, however, that he
was still thinking of his brother, and I was not
sure whether he was expecting a word of sympathy,
or not. I reckoned he had been talking
more to relieve his mind than for any other purpose.
And finally he went on with it:</p>

<p>&#8220;Alf and I talked it over as we walked down
to the docks. I told him I was sick of Uncle
Jothan&#8217;s nagging. I wished he&#8217;d pick the one
he wanted and close the discussion. I believed
the price we&#8217;d have to pay for his money was
too great, anyway.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But money&#8217;s a good thing,&#8217; says Alf. &#8216;And
Uncle Jothan has got a good deal of it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I believe too much money spoils folks,
Alf,&#8217; says I.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We could stand some spoiling,&#8217; he returns,
laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Look at uncle himself,&#8217; says I. &#8216;He&#8217;s
spoiled.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m not afraid of being spoiled by it,&#8217; says
Alf.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I believe it would hurt you as quick as anybody,&#8217;
I told him. And that riled him, though I
had no thought that it would.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Speak for yourself, Jim,&#8217; says he. &#8216;Money&#8217;s
worth going after.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We&#8217;ve had everything equal so far, Alf,&#8217;
says I. &#8216;I&#8217;m not hungry for his money.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And I suppose you think I am?&#8217; and then
I saw he <i>was</i> miffed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The one that tries to get the best of the
other for the sake of Uncle Jothan&#8217;s money, will
show he&#8217;s hungry,&#8217; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then call it what you like, Jim!&#8217; he cries.
&#8216;I&#8217;m going after it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;How?&#8217; says I.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m going to beat you back to Baltimore,&#8217;
says he.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ll be hard to beat,&#8217; I told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wait and see!&#8217; cried Alf, and with that he
flung off from me and went his way to the
Seamew alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to do an errand. When I got aboard
the Gullwing the two schooners were just about
to pull out. It was then old Cap&#8217;n Si made his
bet with Cap&#8217;n Joe. I believe Alf put him up
to it. When I saw Alf in Buenos Ayres I told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
him so, and he didn&#8217;t deny it,&#8221; said Mr. Barney,
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we met in the other ports we had
words. I&#8217;m blamed sorry now, but it&#8217;s too late
to patch it up. I&#8217;ll tell you honest, Webb, I
don&#8217;t care who gets Uncle Jothan&#8217;s money and
the job with the firm; but I&#8217;m going to not let
Alf beat me to Baltimore if I can help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went aft then without another word; but
I did a good deal of thinking about the friction
between the two Barneys. Privately I liked
Mr. Jim Barney the better of the two; but it
was a wicked shame that the head of Barney,
Blakesley &amp; Knight should have set the twins
by their ears in this way. Money was at the
root of the trouble. Mr. Jothan Barney seemed
about to devote his wealth to as bad a cause as
my grandfather had tried to devote <i>his</i> property.</p>

<p>The Gullwing struck a streak of headwinds
soon after this and we wallowed along without
making much headway. That made us all feel
pretty sure. It was a chance that the Seamew
might have forged so far ahead of us that she
had escaped these contrary winds entirely.</p>

<p>Captain Bowditch was on deck almost all the
time. His better seamanship began to be displayed
now. He took advantage of every flaw
in the wind. He had us making sail, and reefing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
down, most of the time, and Bob Promise
grumbled that we topmen had better stay up
there in the rigging all the time, and have our
meals brought to us by the cook.</p>

<p>We saw nothing of the Seamew, and that
added to our anxiety, too. Days passed and we
crossed the line, under the heat of a tropical
sun that fairly stewed the pitch out of the deck
planks. Dao Singh seemed the only person
aboard that accepted the heat with good temper.</p>

<p>We rigged an awning for our passenger, and
Phillis lived under it both day and night. She
was getting plump and hearty, however; surely
the voyage was doing her no harm. And she was
the sweetest tempered, jolliest little thing one
could imagine. It cheered a fellow up and
made him ashamed to be grouchy, just to be
near her.</p>

<p>She liked Thankful Polk, and he amused her
by the hour. The officers were pretty easy on
Thank and I as long as we were with her. To
me she clung as though I really was her brother&mdash;and
I was proud that she so favored me.</p>

<p>Phillis told me much of her life in India&mdash;as
far back as she could remember it. She had
come out from England when she was very
small. On her last birthday she had been
twelve. But little that she could tell me would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
help in finding her relatives&mdash;if she had any.</p>

<p>Her father, Captain Erskin Duane, had not
been in active service. Not as far as she knew,
at least. He had been an invalid for months;
but had died very suddenly. There seemed to
have been few army friends, and the people she
had sailed with from Calcutta she had hardly
ever seen before the captain&#8217;s death.</p>

<p>I had tried pumping Dao Singh about the
private history of the little girl; but either he
knew nothing about the captain&#8217;s affairs, or he
would not tell me. He was as simple, apparently,
as a child about his own expectations.
He had insisted upon accompanying the little
Memsahib in her voyage &#8220;because she needed
him.&#8221; <i>Why</i> he thought she needed him he
could not, or would not, explain.</p>

<p>For my part I told Phillis everything about
myself, and recounted, from time to time, all
the adventures through which I had been since
leaving Bolderhead. I told her much about my
mother, too, and about Darringford House, and
our summer home on Bolderhead Neck.</p>

<p>I assured her that I should take her at once
to my mother when we landed and that I knew
my mother would be delighted to give her a
home with us. This seemed to please the little
girl greatly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>&#8220;Then we shall really be brother and sister,
sha&#8217;n&#8217;t we?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be splendid! For, do you know,
Clinton, I think you are the very nicest brother
I could have picked out. You are just as nice
as I dreamed you would be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; said I. &#8220;You have said that before.
How do you mean, that you <i>dreamed</i> about me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I did. Only it was a dream that came
true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that you dreamed of me when you
were aboard that boat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! it was long before that. It was
soon after we left Calcutta that I saw you,&#8221;
she said, confidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Philly!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;That&#8217;s impossible,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I <i>did</i> dream about you,&#8221; she returned,
seriously. &#8220;I knew that I was in a little boat.
I thought I was all alone on the great ocean.
And I was frightened, and sick&mdash;just as I <i>was</i>
frightened and sick when the time came. But
you came to me, and told me you would save
me, and you held me in your arms just as you
<i>did</i> hold me afterward all the way to this ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was so positive that she had dreamed it
all before, that I saw it was no use to gainsay it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
And then, why should I contradict her? Perhaps
she had had some secret and wonderful assurance
that she would be saved from the wreck.
I did not understand the clairvoyant part of it,
or whatever it might be; so I did not touch upon
the subject again.</p>

<p>It was after that that the great gale struck us
and the staunch Gullwing was battered continually
for a week. We ran almost under bare
poles for a time, and fortunately the gale favored
us. But we lost our mizzen topmast completely
and some of our other rigging was
wrecked.</p>

<p>Phillis had to remain below during this storm,
and she was sick again. She cried so for me
that the captain&mdash;kind old man that he was&mdash;let
me go down to her whenever I could be
spared from the deck. The child seemed to
feel that she was perfectly safe if I was with
her.</p>

<p>Her constant trust in me made a strong impression
upon my mind. Nor was it an unpleasant
impression. Nobody had ever leaned
before on me as this child did&mdash;not even my
mother. It made me feel more manly and put
me on my very best behavior.</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>In Which the Sister Ships Once More Race
Neck to Neck</i></p>
</div>

<p>That gale hit the Gullwing harder than any
blow she had been through (so Mr. Barney said)
since she had left Baltimore. We could not do
much toward making repairs until the gale had
blown out; we only cleared away the wreckage
aloft, reefed everything snug, and let her drive.</p>

<p>Captain Bowditch worried like an old hen
with a mess of ducklings. I don&#8217;t know when
the old man slept. He was on deck every moment
of his own watch, and I could hear him
often roaring orders during our watch below.</p>

<p>This was the time when the fact that the
Gullwing was short-handed made the crew groan.
It was up and down at all hours for us. If
there was a lull in the gale we were yanked out
and sent aloft to risk an inch more canvas.
Cap&#8217;n Joe coaxed her along every chance he
saw. The thought of getting ahead of the Seamew
obsessed the Old Man&#8217;s mind while he <i>was</i>
awake, that was sure!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>We discussed our chances forward with much
eagerness, too. The Seamew had left us behind
during the fair weather; we could make up our
minds to that. But now we had a better chance.
The Gullwing was better worked, short of hands
as she was, than the Seamew.</p>

<p>I remembered vividly how Cap&#8217;n Si Somes
hopped about, and bawled orders, and seemed to
get in his own way when a squall came up, or
the weather was unfavorable. He was a more
nervous man that our skipper; and, I believed,
he was nowhere near so good a seaman. At
least, I had got that idea in my head, and comparing
the actions of the two skippers in a squall,
I guessed any unprejudiced person would have
accepted my view as correct.</p>

<p>We came out of this blow at last, fair weather
returned, and Phillis had her awning re-rigged,
and was able to come on deck again, although
the Atlantic billows were tumbling heavily.</p>

<p>All hands were busy on the new rigging. The
captain had got up a spare spar and Old Tom
Thornton and Stronson, went to work on that.
The captain was determined to get up a new
mizzen topmast and bend on new sails. Every
square inch of canvas spread to the favoring
breeze would aid us in the race home.</p>

<p>We had gotten now into the greatest ocean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
current in the world&mdash;the Gulf Stream. Ocean
currents are mysterious phenomena. The source
of energy required to set and keep the vast
masses of water in motion has been productive of
endless discussion.</p>

<p>Temperature, barometric pressure, attractive
force of the moon, have all been advanced as
bringing about ocean currents. Seamen believe
that it is the wind that brings about certain
oceanic movements. But the winds do not explain
the reason entirely&mdash;not even in any single
case. As to the direct action of the wind on the
surface of the sea alone, it has been shown that
with a wind blowing at twenty-five miles an
hour the surface water would have a movement
of not more than fifteen miles in the twenty-four
hours! The Gulf Stream is the greatest of the
Atlantic currents, if not the greatest current on
the wet portion of the globe. It is really a
wonderful river&mdash;a river flowing through an
ocean. Its temperature is different from the
surrounding waters, it is of a different color, and
the edge of it can be noted almost exactly wherever
a ship crosses into or out of the Gulf Stream.</p>

<p>This warm current starts between the coast of
Cuba and the Florida reefs, and certainly with
this mighty current the wind has absolutely
nothing to do. The force of the current is at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
its maximum strength when it emerges from the
Bemimi Straits, between the Bahama Bank on
the east and the coast of Florida on the West.
Between Fowey Rocks and Gun Gay Light the
average depth of the Gulf Stream is 239 fathoms,
and it runs at a speed of fifty miles in the
twenty-four hours. Occasionally, under particular
circumstances, it will speed up to a hundred
miles in the twenty-four hours. Little
wonder that homeward bound windjammers are
glad to strike the Gulf Stream. After we
crossed into the clear azure of that current there
was a steady tug on the Gullwing&#8217;s prow.</p>

<p>&#8220;The women-folks are pullin&#8217; her home with
their apron strings,&#8221; chuckled Captain Bowditch.</p>

<p>I rigged fishing tackle for Phillis and she
caught some of the smaller fish of the Gulf
Stream&mdash;fish which cannot be caught in the
waters even a short distance outside of the line
of the current. They were brilliant trunk-fish,
and angel-fish, and the like; not edible, but
interesting to look at.</p>

<p>Shark were plentiful, too, and followed the
ship like dogs, to fight for the scraps the cook
flung overboard. Thank got a big hook and
about a pound of fat pork (he could wheedle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
anything out of the black cook) bent on a strong
line, and we trolled for shark.</p>

<p>We caught one about eight foot long; he was
an ugly beast, and fought like a tiger when we
got him onto the deck. He would snap at a
broomstick and bite it through as neatly as we
could have cut it with an axe. A sailor hates a
shark just as the ordinary man ashore dislikes a
snake.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what we&#8217;ll do with him,&#8221; said Bob
Promise, chuckling. &#8220;I seen it done on the old
Beatrix two years ago. We &#8216;belled the cat&#8217; with
an old he shark, and it&#8217;s an all right trick to play
on the dirty critters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;ye do it?&#8221; asked Tom Thornton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lemme have that broken broomstick,&#8221; said
Bob, grabbing it. &#8220;Now watch&mdash;when he snaps
at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The huge fish, lying on its side, with its wicked
eye watchful of us all, opened wide his jaws when
Bob Promise approached. The bully was a
reckless fellow, and as the shark snapped open
his jaws he thrust his hand and arm into the
cavity and thrust the stick upright, far back in
the beast&#8217;s throat.</p>

<p>Thank actually screamed aloud, and I felt
sick&mdash;I thought sure the foolish fellow&#8217;s arm
would be snapped off between the closing jaws.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>But the shark couldn&#8217;t close his jaws! That
was the trick of it. The stick was thrust upright,
sticking into the roof of the great mouth
and into the root of the tongue. The fish was
&#8220;belled&#8221; indeed.</p>

<p>There it writhed upon the deck, thrashing its
strong tail about, its wicked eyes rolling, and
evidently in awful agony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now pitch him overboard,&#8221; laughed Bob
Promise. &#8220;He&#8217;ll live some time that way&mdash;mebbe
till he starves to death or until some of
the smaller fish pitch upon him and eat his liver
out. Ugh! the ugly beast!&#8221;</p>

<p>Somebody took a turn of the rope around the
fish&#8217;s tail and in a moment the shark was swung
up by the falls we had rigged. But while he
hung in the air and was about to be swung over
the rail, Phillis ran up to us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do it! I saw you!
How could you be so dreadfully mean&mdash;Oh!
Clint! how could <i>you</i> do such a cruel thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had been thinking all the time that it was a
blamed mean piece of business; but I hadn&#8217;t
had the pluck to say so!</p>

<p>&#8220;You stand away, Missee,&#8221; laughed Bob.
&#8220;He&#8217;s all right. Overboard he goes&mdash;plop into
the sea&mdash;and it will be one murderin&#8217; old shark
fixed jest right.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>&#8220;You shall not do it!&#8221; she cried, and she was
so earnest and excited that she stamped her little
foot upon the deck. &#8220;It is wicked and cruel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; but an old shark,
Missee,&#8221; growled Tom Thornton. &#8220;He ain&#8217;t
fit for nothing better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s God&#8217;s creature. God made him,&#8221; declared
the child. &#8220;You&#8217;ve no right to maltreat
him. It&#8217;s wicked. I won&#8217;t have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was so excited I was afraid she would get
sick. I put in <i>my</i> oar:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Philly. None of us stopped
to think of that side of it. Lower away here,
boys, and we&#8217;ll knock that prop out of his
mouth again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No you won&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed Bob Promise.</p>

<p>I stopped and looked at him. &#8220;Why, sure,
Bob, you don&#8217;t mind. If the little girl doesn&#8217;t
want us to do it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stow that,&#8221; said Bob, in his very ugliest
tone. &#8220;That shark ain&#8217;t hers. I put that stick
there. I want to see the man that&#8217;ll pull it
out,&#8221; and he swelled up like a turkey-cock and
acted as though he thought he was the biggest
man who ever stepped on the Gullwing&#8217;s deck.</p>

<p>But if he had been twice as big I reckon I
should have stepped up to him! To have anybody
speak before Phillis as he did was not to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
endured. Thankful Polk flamed up, too, until
you could have touched off a match on his face.
Old Tom Thornton reached an arm across and
put me back as lightly as though I had been a
feather, and seized the rope above Bob&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop it, you landcrab!&#8221; he growled. Old
Tom seldom got angry; when he did we knew
enough to stand from under!</p>

<p>And then appeared Dao Singh. How he had
heard the racket I do not know. Light as a
panther, and with an eye wickeder than the
shark&#8217;s own, he slid along the deck and stood
right at the other elbow of the bully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the rope go, as Webb Sahib say,&#8221; he
hissed into Bob&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p>The bully was as amazed as he could well be
and keep on his pins. He stepped back and
glared from Thank and me to Old Tom, and then
around at Singh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Holy mackerel!&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Do the
hull of ye&#8217;s want the blamed fish? Then, take
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>The watch burst out laughing. Mr. Barney
had himself come forward, and now he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get a harpoon, Webb, and kill the beast at
once. That will settle the controversy. I&#8217;m
not sure that the little one isn&#8217;t right. We&#8217;re
all too big to torture even such a beast as a shark.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>That was the kind of influence Phillis Duane
had over all of us. The captain had her on the
bridge with him and showed her everything he
did when he took the sun&#8217;s altitude, and all
that. Mr. Gates talked with her by the hour.
Mr. Barney was forever finding something new
with which she could amuse herself. And the
black cook and Dao Singh almost came to blows
over who should wait upon her the most.</p>

<p>Then came the day when, off Hatteras, we
sighted another four-masted ship. She crept
out of a fogbank to leeward of us and it was
some time before we saw her clearly enough to be
sure. That she was tacking northward was the
main fact at first which urged us to believe it
was our sister ship.</p>

<p>But in an hour it came clearer, and we could
be sure. It was the Seamew, standing in very
prettily, and it was plain she had sighted us,
too. We tacked and her course brought her
across our stern. We ran so near the captains
could hail each other. Old Cap&#8217;n Si waved his
glass and shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re about to bid you a fond farewell, Joe!
Next tack will put us ahead of you. That
apple&#8217;s mine, by jolly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me if I had such a great craft as
the Seamew, I&#8217;d have got farther ahead than you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
be now,&#8221; returned our skipper, with scorn. &#8220;I
reckon the race ain&#8217;t over yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty near over. We got good weather
comin&#8217;. The Seamew can walk away with you
in a fair wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Brag&#8217;s a good dog, but Holdfast&#8217;s
a better one,&#8221; said Cap&#8217;n Joe. &#8220;Wait till we
sight the Capes o&#8217; Virginia.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was too far away from us then for Cap&#8217;n
Si to shout again. The rest of us had grinned
or scowled at the men aboard the Seamew, as
our natures dictated. I had noticed that the
boat found adrift with Singh and Phillis in it,
had been hoisted aboard the Seamew and was
lashed amidships.</p>

<p>Away we went on our tack, came about, and
again neared our rival. The Seamew was not
pulling away from us much; the wind was heavy.
The Gullwing crept up on her and, finally, when
the Seamew tacked again, we did the same and
she had no chance to cross our bows, even had
she been able to.</p>

<p>So we sailed, neck and neck, not half a mile
from each other, both ships plunging through the
swells with a line of white foam under their
quarters, and well heeled over to the wind.
Whichever won the race&mdash;whether the Gullwing
or the Seamew&mdash;it would be a good fight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXII</span></h2>


<p class="ph1"><i>In Which the Capes of Virginia Are In Sight</i></p>
</div>

<p>We had a stiff wind blowing&mdash;half a gale, indeed&mdash;and
when we raised other sailing ships,
their canvas was clewed down and some of them
were running under little more than stormsails.
But neither the captain of the Seamew nor of the
Gullwing had any intention of losing a breath of
such a favorable breeze.</p>

<p>Our ship heeled over until her rail was under
water; and she was laden so heavily that this
sort of sailing was perilous. Suppose some of
the cargo should shift? Where would we be?
Well, just about there, I guess!</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day the old man will carry the sticks out
of her completely,&#8221; growled Mr. Gates to Mr.
Barney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let him!&#8221; exclaimed the second mate.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to win this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; I heard the other ask, curiously.
&#8220;Just so Cap&#8217;n Joe will win his greening apple?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Barney cursed the captain and his apple.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want us to win anyway, eh?&#8221; pursued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
Mr. Gates, in his slow, thoughtful way. &#8220;No
matter what happens to the Gullwing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s insured; so&#8217;s her freight,&#8221; snapped Mr.
Barney.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter if both good ships should
founder and be lost?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t give a hang!&#8221; exclaimed the younger
man, bitterly, &#8220;as long as the Gullwing goes
down fifty fathoms nearer Baltimore than the
Seamew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how about the crews?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s thinking of men&mdash;or ships&mdash;just
now?&#8221; demanded Mr. Barney. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t both
captains risking lives and property for a silly
competition? I&#8217;m no worse than they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so, the rivalry of Cap&#8217;n Joe and Cap&#8217;n
Si will excuse your own mad determination to
get to port first?&#8221; suggested Mr. Gates, quietly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;ll feel that way, young
man, twelve months from now. And how about
the little girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! there&#8217;s no danger,&#8221; said Mr. Barney,
lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope there will be no danger&mdash;no more than
there is now, at least,&#8221; said the mate, significantly.
Then he saw me on lookout and said,
irritably: &#8220;Come away! This is no place to
talk.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>I wondered what the mate thought Mr.
Barney would do for the sake of helping the
Gullwing to win the race; but I heard nothing
more of their conversation. This occurred in
the evening when we could just see the ghostly
sails of the Seamew as she stood on for us. Mr.
Barney soon after took the wheel himself, it
being the captain&#8217;s watch. From that point on
to the end the second mate was more frequently
at the wheel than at any previous time during
the cruise.</p>

<p>Day and night the two huge schooners ran
almost even. Our skipper was seldom off the
deck. I don&#8217;t know when he found time to
sleep. He never lost a chance to make the most
of a puff of wind. The men worked for him
eagerly and well; but they stood double watches.</p>

<p>Some of the small sails Cap&#8217;n Joe even had us
dip overboard so that, well wetted, they would
better hold the wind. It was four bells in the
morning watch when the Seamew crossed our
bow. She had been trying for it for twenty-four
hours, or more. And when she cut us off and
we had to take her white water, a groan of derision
was raised by her crew.</p>

<p>We were sore&mdash;every man Jack of us. Cap&#8217;n
Joe and Cap&#8217;n Si had it hot and heavy from their
respective stations.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>&#8220;Better give us a line aboard so&#8217;t we can tow
ye in, Joe!&#8221; bawled Cap&#8217;n Si.</p>

<p>&#8220;You air mighty willin&#8217; to give a helpin&#8217;
hand jest now, Si,&#8221; returned our skipper, with
scorn. &#8220;But it warn&#8217;t allus so.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw Mr. Alf Barney at the Seamew&#8217;s wheel.
He handled the ship splendidly. When the
Seamew came about on the other tack, her helmsman
met the waves just right and swung her
over so that the sails scarcely shook at all. She
reared up on one tack, turned as it were on her
heel, and swept away on the other tack at a
speed that sent the spray flying high above her
rail. It was a pretty sight.</p>

<p>Our Mr. Barney stood right beside me as I
manipulated the Gullwing&#8217;s helm. He watched
the handling of our rival with lowering brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme that wheel!&#8221; he snapped, pushing
me away and seizing the spokes. The Gullwing
was right in the eye of the wind. Cap&#8217;n Bowditch
was shouting his orders. If the Seamew
had rounded prettily, the Gullwing went her one
better. We wasted less time hanging in the
wind than the Seamew.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to do it!&#8221; bawled our skipper,
dancing on the quarter. &#8220;By jinks, Mr. Barney,
you handled that wheel well. Keep her so!
Steady.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>The second mate let me take the wheel again
after a minute or two; and his face had remained
unsmiling all the time. He had merely been
determined to show them all that he could handle
the big ship&#8217;s helm as well in every particular as
did his brother.</p>

<p>Our course was west-northwest now to the
Capes of Virginia. The fresh gale was out of
the same quarter. Therefore we had to beat to
windward all the remainder of the race, and although
the Seamew had gotten a little the start
of us, the Gullwing had a slight advantage.
She handled better to windward than her sister
ship.</p>

<p>The Seamew stood off on one tack, we on the
other. She disappeared beyond the sea line,
but standing in some hours later we found her
again&mdash;and finding her were pleased more than
a little in seeing that we had made something
up on her. Our skipper&#8217;s shrewdness was telling.</p>

<p>I knew how it was with Cap&#8217;n Si; when things
broke wrong for him he paddled about the deck,
cursing the hands and the wind and various other
things, altogether irrational. Whereas our skipper
never lost a trick, kept his head, and never
gave an order he was sorry for&mdash;and that last is
saying a good deal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>We filled away once more and stood back to
her. We were making distance fast. Had we
held on this time we should have crossed her
wake almost under her stern. The man aloft
suddenly sang out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Land, ho!&#8221;</p>

<p>I heard the cry repeated in the Seamew&#8217;s tops.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cape Henry, sir!&#8221; shouted our man to the
skipper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye,&#8221; said Cap&#8217;n Joe, eagerly. &#8220;And
when we tack back again we&#8217;re going to cross
ahead of the Seamew&#8217;s bow&mdash;and the race will be
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said it with enormous satisfaction. He believed
it, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why will the race be over, Clint?&#8221; asked
Phillis, who stood beside me at the moment. &#8220;I
looked at the chart. We&#8217;re a long way yet from
Baltimore. We are not in sight of the opening
into Chesapeake Bay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are tugs waiting up there in the roads
for us,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;You&#8217;ll soon see their
smoke. <i>They</i> will race out for us, as we race in
for the port. We shall go up to Baltimore under
steam.&#8221;</p>

<p>And my statement was scarcely made ere we
saw in the far distance the pillars of smoke from
the stacks of the ocean-going tugs. The land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
that had been merely a hazy line, grew more
clearly defined, although we were not approaching
it directly. Soon I could point out to my
little friend the other cape guarding the mouth of
the Chesapeake&mdash;Cape Charles.</p>

<p>The tugs steamed out to meet us under forced
draught. More quickly to get in tow of the tug
nearest us, which was coming already hooked
up, Cap&#8217;n Bowditch put the Gullwing about
earlier than he had originally intended. As we
tacked, so did the Seamew.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s afraid to give us an inch,&#8221; laughed Mr.
Barney, taking his place beside the wheel again,
and looking up at Mr. Gates.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nip and tuck,&#8221; returned the first mate.
Then to the skipper he said: &#8220;Shall I make
ready to take the tug&#8217;s hawser, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right-oh!&#8221; declared Captain Bowditch.
&#8220;And be lively with it. We&#8217;re too close to fool
away a moment. I hope we get the fastest tug.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the Sea Horse, Cap&#8217;n!&#8221; bawled down
the man aloft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smart tug, she is,&#8221; agreed the skipper.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I believe that&#8217;s the Comet makin&#8217; to
meet the Seamew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both Norfolk Tug Company&#8217;s craft&mdash;and
good ones. I wouldn&#8217;t give a dollar bonus either
way on &#8217;em, would you, Mr. Gates?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>&#8220;They&#8217;re just as near alike as the Seamew and
the Gullwing are alike,&#8221; agreed the mate, and
went forward.</p>

<p>We were standing in now directly for the
channel. The Seamew was headed likewise.
We were bound to pass close to our sister ship&mdash;so
close that, as the moments slipped past, I
began to feel some disturbance of mind.</p>

<p>Heaven knows the ocean was broad enough;
but the two skippers were obstinate and eager.
One would not be likely to want to give way
to the other. And moment after moment the
two great ships, their canvas filled and the
white water split in great waves from their
prows, rushed closer and closer together.</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>In Which We Face Death by the Breadth of a Hair</i></p>
</div>

<p>I had walked forward, anxious over the
situation of the sister ships. Tom Thornton
was right by my side, for Mr. Barney had taken
the wheel himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;In case of doubt,&#8221; I asked Tom, &#8220;who gives
way&mdash;the Seamew or the Gullwing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the Seamew, of course,&#8221; growled
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I be,&#8221; he said, emphatically. &#8220;No gittin&#8217;
around it. It has to be her gives way&mdash;not us.
Both of us are close-hauled, that&#8217;s a fact; but
we on this tack has the right of way. The
Seamew&#8217;s got to come about and give us the
road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She don&#8217;t look like she would,&#8221; I said,
gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course she will!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she&#8217;ll miss meeting the other tug this
time. It will give us a big advantage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ye suppose our skipper knows that?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
returned Tom, with a wide grin. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what he aimed to do. Oh, Cap&#8217;n Joe is a
cleaner, now I tell ye!&#8221;</p>

<p>It did look to me as though the two great
ships were rushing together. If they had been
two old-time frigates, aiming to come to a clinch
and the crews ordered to &#8220;board with cutlass,&#8221;
the appearance of the two could have been no
more threatening.</p>

<p>The Seamew&#8217;s men were grouped along her
rail and swinging in her lower shrouds, watching
us; and every person aboard the Gullwing,
including the cook, was on deck. I heard
Captain Bowditch growling to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that lobster mean? Ain&#8217;t he
goin&#8217; to give us no seaway?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Barney had taken the wheel of the Gullwing.
I saw that his brother was already
glued to the spokes of the Seamew&#8217;s wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ware what ye do there, Mr. Barney,&#8221;
sang out Captain Bowditch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep her steady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>I caught old Tom by the sleeve of his jumper
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cap&#8217;n Si don&#8217;t mean to give way!&#8221; I
gasped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; said the old seaman, reflectively,
&#8220;it&#8217;ll be up to him if he doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t our place to give that blamed Seamew
the whole ocean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if the Seamew <i>won&#8217;t</i> give way?&#8221; I
repeated, vainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Not give way! That&#8217;d be foolish,&#8221;
growled old Tom. &#8220;A man can go bullying
his way ashore, pushin&#8217; folks inter the gutter
and all that, if he&#8217;s big enough&mdash;like Bob yonder.
But a captain can&#8217;t do that at sea. He&#8217;d
only git what&#8217;s due him. He&#8217;ll <i>have</i> to give
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet no order was given from the Seamew&#8217;s
quarter; nor did our skipper say a word. I
could not believe that Captain Bowditch, even
with the sea-law on his side, would risk his
beautiful ship and the lives of her crew. Yet if
the Seamew continued to run in on us much
longer we would have to fall off, or collide with
her.</p>

<p>Little Phillis was sitting calmly under her
awning, busied with some pieces of sewing&mdash;for
she was a housewifely little thing. It
struck me that an awful death was threatening
the innocent child, and I moved toward her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
Thankful Polk was working his way along the
deck in the same direction, too.</p>

<p>Captain Bowditch glanced at the child under
the awning. If he had had any desperate
intention of keeping on, whether or no, so as
to pick up his tug ahead of the Seamew, I believe
the presence of Phillis Duane restrained
him. His hard old face changed.</p>

<p>The Seamew was holding on. She was going
to force us. The old man jumped to the
rail and motioned with his arm for the helmsman
of the Seamew to keep off. But Mr. Alf Barney&#8217;s
gaze rested only on the face of his brother
at <i>our</i> wheel; and Captain Somes never gave
an order.</p>

<p>Captain Bowditch turned and yelled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep off! keep off, I say! D&#8217;ye wanter
wreck us?&#8221;</p>

<p>He started for the wheel. I do not know
whether our Mr. Barney obeyed the order&mdash;or
tried to obey it. The two great ships, their
canvas bellied with the strong gale, seemed to
sweep together as though they were magnetized!</p>

<p>It may have been explained by the fact that
we were so near each other that one took the
wind out of the other&#8217;s sails. At least, the two
huge ships were no longer under control.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hanged if she ain&#8217;t got away from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
him!&#8221; I heard Tom Thornton yell; but which
ship he meant I did not know.</p>

<p>The Gullwing took a shoot. The Seamew
took a shoot. Then the two ships clinched!</p>

<p>Talk about a smash! It was the most awful
collision one could imagine. Two express trains
on the same track, coming head-on, could have
made no greater explosion of sound. And it
did seem as though no other kind of a collision
could have resulted in so much wreckage.</p>

<p>I grabbed up Phillis just before the ships
came together, and dashed for the companionway.
But as I gained its shelter I saw the
spars raining from aloft on both vessels, with
the canvas and cordage in a perfect jumble.</p>

<p>It fairly shook the spars out of the Seamew.
I believed, at the last moment, that the Gullwing
had sheered off. At least, she had taken
the blow on more of a slant. The wire stays
upon our sister ship had been torn away and
her foremast came down and hung over the
rail a complete wreck.</p>

<p>Her other masts wavered. I could see that
she was shaking like a wounded thing; I believe
she was settling even then. She had
opened a great hole in her hull forward. I
could see the ragged, splintered ends of the
planks.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>Our own damage and peril I could not gauge
until I had set Phillis down and rushed back to
the deck. The old Gullwing was hobbling
away from her sister ship. Captain Bowditch
was bawling orders from the bridge; but I
heard nothing but screams of rage and fear
from the Seamew. <i>And Captain Si Somes was
no longer in sight.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Axes, men!&#8221; roared our skipper. &#8220;Get
aloft there! Cut away wreckage! Clew up
everything that ain&#8217;t torn away. Look alive,
up there, Mr. Gates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir!&#8221; responded the mate from
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep her steady, Mr. Barney!&#8221; commanded
the captain.</p>

<p>I heard no response. I glanced aft as I
worked my way up the backstays. Mr. Jim
Barney still stood at our wheel. He hung to
the spokes and held the ship steady. But a
whiter face and a more miserable face I had
never seen upon mortal man.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XXIV</span></h2>


<p class="ph1"><i>In Which the Tragedy of the Racing Ship Is
Completed</i></p>
</div>

<p>League upon league of the sea&mdash;across and
again across two oceans&mdash;the sister ships had
raced, to fall afoul of each other here almost
within sight of port!</p>

<p>While we aboard the Gullwing were cutting
adrift the wreckage for dear life, another mast&mdash;the
mizzen&mdash;fell across the Seamew. She was
down dreadfully by the head. We could hear
the roar of the water pouring into the hole
stove in her hull.</p>

<p>I knew Mr. Hollister&#8217;s voice, and he was
shouting orders to the crew. But nobody
heard Cap&#8217;n Si speaking; nor was he in sight.
I knew as well then as I did afterward that,
at the moment of the collision, the master of
the Seamew went overboard, sank, and never
came up again!</p>

<p>Down came the aftermast of the Seamew;
the mainmast was swaying. I reckon the crew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
responded to Mr. Hollister&#8217;s orders not at all.
I heard the wail of:</p>

<p>&#8220;Boats! boats! take to the boats!&#8221;</p>

<p>But when they took another look at the
wabbling masts, they waited to launch no
boat. With a few words but much action the
crew went over her rail, now almost even with
the sea, and one after the other began to claw
out for the Gullwing which lay to not two
cable&#8217;s lengths away from the sinking ship.</p>

<p>But Mr. Alfred Barney held to the spokes
of her wheel; he made no offer to leave the
Seamew, although Mate Hollister, like the men,
was already in the sea.</p>

<p>As I hacked at the steel cordage and broken
spars I heard Captain Bowditch shouting directions
to the men below, and to the men in
the water. Ropes and life-buoys were flung to
the seamen from the sinking ship. In this comparatively
quiet sea there was little likelihood of
any of them being drowned.</p>

<p>Mr. Hollister waited to see his hands drawn
over the rail of the Gullwing before he came
inboard himself. But while this was going on
Captain Bowditch discovered the missing second
mate still on the wreck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come away from that!&#8221; he shouted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
Alfred Barney. &#8220;Come on! Jump in! We&#8217;ll
haul you out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man made no reply, nor did he
move from the wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come away, you fool!&#8221; roared Captain
Bowditch.</p>

<p>But Alfred Barney, like Jim Barney, seemed
frozen to the spokes of the wheel. The thought
in my confused mind was: <i>Had the two brothers
deliberately wrecked the sister ships?</i></p>

<p>The Gullwing had recovered from the shock
of the collision. She was not going to sink&mdash;at
least, not right away. All her crew were
inboard now, and Mr. Hollister followed. Nobody
spoke of poor Cap&#8217;n Si. We all knew
that he was missing. But there was a great
to-do about Alfred Barney.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that etarnal fool want to stay
over there for?&#8221; yelled Captain Joe to Mr.
Hollister. &#8220;Is he a dummy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He iss <i>fey</i>,&#8221; whispered old Stronson in my
ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like it was his fault the ships came
together,&#8221; said Bob Promise.</p>

<p>We had descended to the deck again now.
Our upper works were in an awful tangle; but
we could do no more at present. The tug was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
steaming in near to us now and it did not matter
if we did drift.</p>

<p>All our eyes were fastened upon the Seamew.
She was going down steadily, head-on. Already
her bows were being lapped by the waves
clear to the butt of the jib-boom.</p>

<p>Mr. Hollister sent another wailing cry across
to the second mate at the Seamew&#8217;s wheel;
but the figure did not move, nor did Alf Barney
make any reply.</p>

<p>Suddenly our Mr. Barney left the helm. He
just motioned to me, and I grabbed the spokes.
He sprang to the rail and held out both his
arms to his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come! Alf, Alf! Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then it was that Alfred Barney turned his
head and looked across at us. His face, white
as his brother&#8217;s had been, broke into a frosty
smile. He raised one hand and waved it to
his twin. And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There was a roar of sound, a rush of wind,
a yell in chorus from all hands aboard the Gullwing,
and the mainmast of the Seamew came
rushing down, astern! The great spar had
been shaken loose and it fell with all its weight
along the deck of the laboring schooner. The
topmast broke off and sprang into the air, along
with a tangle of steel cable and shredded sails.</p>

<p>And when that topmast struck the deck
again it wrecked the Seamew&#8217;s wheel and
pinioned Mr. Alfred Barney beneath its wreckage!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>A general shout of horror arose from the Gullwing;
but above it rang the clarion tone of
Jim Barney&#8217;s voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Boat! Boat! Launch the quarterboat!&#8221;</p>

<p>Our men sprang to their stations; the young
second mate gave his orders quick and sharp.
Captain Bowditch did not gainsay him. Mr.
Jim Barney had it all his own way.</p>

<p>His crew&mdash;the same that had manned the boat
when she had picked up the castaways&mdash;quickly
took their places in the craft. She was lowered
with a plop into the sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give way, men!&#8221;</p>

<p>They bent to the oars like giants. The boat
shot across the sea to the fast sinking Seamew.
I held the spokes of the Gullwing&#8217;s wheel idly
and watched. Indeed, the tug coming up to
hook us attracted no attention from anybody
aboard our ship at that moment.</p>

<p>The Seamew was wallowing deep in the
water now. Her head was under and her stern
was kicking up. She was about to dive like a
duck to the bottom.</p>

<p>Suddenly the air-pressure below blew off
her forward hatch. Instantly the waves broke
across the deck and the water poured into the
open hatchway.</p>

<p>Swiftly and more swiftly she sank. When
our boat came to the hulk, she presented a steep
side for one to mount from the small boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alf! Alf!&#8221; we heard our second mate yell.
We could not hear that there was an answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
from the man under the wreckage of the topmast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold her in close, boys!&#8221; commanded Mr.
Jim Barney. &#8220;Give me that boathook!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be drowned, sir!&#8221; I heard Thankful
Polk cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s going down&mdash;she&#8217;ll suck us all under,&#8221;
declared Bob Promise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand by, as I tell you!&#8221; commanded the
second mate again.</p>

<p>In a moment he had fastened the boathook
somehow, and went up hand over hand. He
seized the rail of the sinking ship. The small
boat backed away. I believe Bob Promise
thrust her off with his oar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out there!&#8221; bawled Captain Bowditch,
from our poop. &#8220;You&#8217;re taking your
life in your hand, lad!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jim Barney merely waved his hand,
notifying the master of the Gullwing that his
warning had been heard. But he crawled
right up to the stern over that wreckage. He
did not look back once.</p>

<p>And down settled the Seamew, lower and
lower. She was under seas as far back as the
stump of the mainmast. The water boiled
around her. There was good reason for our
men in the quarterboat to back off. Once
caught in the suck of the sinking ship, our men
and their craft would go under, too!</p>

<p>I saw Mr. Jim Barney spring over a pile of
debris. He stooped, tore away some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
wrecked stuff, and then stood up with his
brother&#8217;s body clasped in his arms.</p>

<p>For an instant I saw the white face of the
unconscious man. There was a streak of crimson
on his forehead. Jim Barney looked down
into the countenance of his brother and the
men in our quarterboat uttered in chorus a long-drawn
cry. The Seamew was going down.</p>

<p>Slowly, the eddying water seething about her
wounded hull, the ship settled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jump!&#8221; shouted Cap&#8217;n Bowditch, leaning
over the rail, his own face pallid and his eyes
aglare.</p>

<p>But that would not have saved them. Mr.
Barney could not have leaped far enough with
his burden to have overcome the suck of the
maelstrom forming about the wreck. And it
was right for the men in the small boat to sheer
off.</p>

<p>The wreck slid under the surface. Almost
the last thing we saw was Mr. Barney, holding
his burden in his arms, his own face still bent
above the unconscious countenance of his
brother.</p>

<p>The boat from the Gullwing was so near the
maelstrom caused by the sinking of the ship
that her bow was sucked under and she shipped
a lot of water. We saw the boys bailing energetically.</p>

<p>Then Thank stood up and cast off his outer
clothing and his shoes. Bob Promise, who
pulled the bow oar, followed suit. They each
took the precaution to lash the end of a line to
one wrist before going overboard. Where the
Seamew had sunk was a circle of tossing waves,
and broken bits of wreckage were popping up
from below in a most dangerous fashion.</p>

<p>The suspense aboard the Gullwing and in
the boat was great indeed as the two young
fellows went down. If the Barneys had been
entangled in any wreckage on the lost vessel,
Thank and Bob would never be able to reach
them, for the sea at that spot is very deep, and
the hulk of the schooner would finally rest upon
the bottom.</p>

<p>Mr. Gates had run back to the stern and stood
beside me, gazing off across the tumbling sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;God help the boy!&#8221; he muttered, and I
knew he referred to our Mr. Barney. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
doubt now he&#8217;d rather be under the seas than
above after this day&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe it was Mr. Barney&#8217;s fault?&#8221;
I whispered.</p>

<p>He started and looked around at me. I
repeated my question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it Jim Barney&#8217;s fault?&#8221; he returned.
&#8220;What do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it. He sheered off&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late,&#8221; muttered Mr. Gates.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as soon as the captain ordered him
to,&#8221; I declared eagerly. &#8220;When Captain Bowditch
ordered him to &#8216;Keep off&#8217; he swung her
over. I saw him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was too late then, I tell you,&#8221; declared
the first mate of the Gullwing.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how about Mr. Alf Barney?&#8221; I cried.
&#8220;He held on to the course all the time till she
hit us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Gates said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it was anybody&#8217;s fault it was Mr. Alf
Barney&#8217;s,&#8221; I repeated, stubbornly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. It cannot be laid to his fault in any
case,&#8221; said the mate, sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not, sir?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because his captain gave no order. Captain
Si had the deck. He was in command.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Captain Bowditch is at fault, too,&#8221;
I declared. &#8220;He did not speak quick enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He gave the order quick enough,&#8221; returned
Mr. Gates, gloomily, &#8220;but Jim Barney hesitated.
That&#8217;s where the fault lies. Jim Barney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
hated to give the Seamew right of way,
and he held us onto the course after he was
ordered to keep off. That&#8217;s where the fault
lies, my boy&mdash;that&#8217;s where it lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>At another time I do not suppose the mate
would have discussed the point with me, I
being merely a foremast hand. But we were
all stirred up and for the moment quarterdeck
etiquette was forgotten.</p>

<p>But in a moment there was a cheer raised in
our little boat, dancing out there on the swells.
Thank&#8217;s head appeared, and one hand grasped
the gunwale of the boat. He dragged into view
the two Barney&#8217;s, locked in an embrace that
could not be broken.</p>

<p>Bob Promise came to his help instantly.
Together they held the twins up. Both the
Barneys were unconscious. Mr. Jim must have
had a frightful fight down there under the sea
to hold to his brother and get out of the strong
suck of the settling wreck.</p>

<p>The brothers were hauled into the small boat,
and then Thank and Bob followed. As quickly
as possible she was rowed back to the Gullwing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the big tug Sea Horse had
steamed up to us and rounded to under our
bows. The hawser was passed and Mr. Gates
took charge of the rigging of the bridle. Our
skipper himself went to the rail to meet the incoming
boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boys,&#8221; he said, warmly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
pity poor old Si warn&#8217;t found, too.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>I wondered if that was so. It seemed to me
that Captain Silas Somes was the man mainly
to blame for the tragedy. I could not believe
that the onus of it would be heaped upon our
second mate.</p>

<p>The boat was hoisted in. Both the Barneys
remained unconscious; but Mr. Hollister and
the captain declared they would be all right
soon. Mr. Alf Barney had not been seriously
injured by the falling of the mast. They were
taken below and Mr. Hollister took charge
of them, with one of his own hands to help in
bringing the brothers back to their senses.</p>

<p>The Gullwing quickly felt the tug of the
hawser binding her to the Sea Horse and with
her sails clewed up she wallowed on through
the choppy seas into the broad mouth of the
Chesapeake.</p>

<p>No need of aiding the steam-tug by hoisting
sail. The race was over. The Seamew had
run her course and the Gullwing was the winner.
But a sorry winning of the race it proved to be.</p>

<p>Mr. Gates kept both watches at work for a
time making the loose spars secure. The steel
stays that had been broken had to be reset, or
we might have one of our masts coming down
as the Seamew&#8217;s had.</p>

<p>The work was done before the second dog-watch
and then we had a chance to sit down and
fraternize with the men from the Seamew.</p>

<p>&#8220;What gave the old Seamew her ticket,&#8221;
said Job Perkins, &#8220;was our changing a live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
man for a dead one. When Clint, here, went
over the side and a man that had been garroted
came back inboard, I knowed we was
in for trouble. And that ten dollars you&#8217;re
to pay me at Baltimore,&#8221; he whispered in my
ear, &#8220;ain&#8217;t going to pay me for the dunnage I
lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;ye s&#8217;pose that feller got strangled
with his lanyard?&#8221; demanded another of the
Seamew&#8217;s men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask that nigger they&#8217;ve got aboard the Gullwing
here,&#8221; growled another. &#8220;He knows.
And he&#8217;ll hafter tell it to the consul.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I made up my mind that, if it were possible,
Dao Singh should not be obliged to go
before any court, or any consul, to explain that
matter. The fact was, there wasn&#8217;t anything
he could explain. Under a dreadful provocation
he had killed the sailor. But I doubted
if his excuse for committing the act would be
accepted by the law.</p>

<p>The men were mainly interested, however,
in the circumstances surrounding the collision
of the sister ships and the sinking of the Seamew.
The great question was: Who was at
fault? But we conducted the discussion in
very low tones, that the officer on deck might not
overhear us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk as ye please,&#8221; grunted Job Perkins.
&#8220;If two other men&mdash;men that warn&#8217;t Barneys&mdash;had
been at the helm of the two ships,
there wouldn&#8217;t never been no trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; declared I, &#8220;<i>our</i> Mr. Barney sheered
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not soon enough,&#8221; said Tom Thornton,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as soon as the order was given!&#8221; I
cried. &#8220;And it wasn&#8217;t our place to give way,
at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Job, &#8220;we&#8217;ll all grant the old man&mdash;Cap&#8217;n
Si&mdash;was the main one to blame.
Leastways, he&#8217;s the one dead, and the dead
man is always blamed. But Mr. Alf Barney
never got no word to change his helm&mdash;and
yours did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The ships come together; they was bound
to do so, sooner or later,&#8221; said old Stronson,
shaking his head. &#8220;It iss not de men iss to
blame&mdash;no! You remember the Chieftain and
de Antelope? Dey was sister ships, too. Dey
could not be anchored within a cable&#8217;s length
of each odder, or dey come togedder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By jings! the old man&#8217;s right,&#8221; declared
Tom Thornton. &#8220;I sailed on the Antelope
once. There seemed to be magnets drawin&#8217;
them two ships together. Gettin&#8217; under way at
Savannah we bumped the Chieftain and tore
away her fore chains and made a mess of our
own bows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heered if the two craft was anchored full
and plenty apart, and in no tideway, they&#8217;d
rub sides within twenty-four hours,&#8221; said
another man.</p>

<p>&#8220;And das iss de trut&#8217;,&#8221; declared Stronson.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
&#8220;Dey wass sister ships&mdash;like das Seamew and
Gullwing. Nopoty can keep dem apart when
dey gets jest so near to each odder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so! I bet that was what did it more
than the Barney boys,&#8221; agreed Job Perkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sich things happen, as we knows,&#8221; said
Tom Thornton.</p>

<p>And I declare, all the old fellows went off on
this tangent and accepted this idea as the true
explanation for the sinking of the Seamew.
They talked it over and became more and more
positive that it was so. The superstition that
the sister ships had a natural attraction for
each other took a firm hold upon their minds.
I could see plainly that if the firm had any of
these old barnacles into court, they would
swear to this ridiculous idea. At least, it might
throw a bit of weight against the idea that the
Barney boys had deliberately wrecked the two
ships.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jest the same,&#8221; observed old Tom, slowly,
&#8220;study on it as we may, there&#8217;s one place where
it&#8217;ll be decided for sure, as far as the legal end
of it goes. The insurance court will have the
last say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrong you be, Tom,&#8221; declared Job, &#8220;wrong
you be. The final settlement of the hull matter
will be in the offices of Barney, Blakesley &amp;
Knight. Never mind what the court says, nor
how the insurance is adjusted; them two boys
will hafter go before the firm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By mighty! that&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Tom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>&#8220;And the way it&#8217;s turned out,&#8221; pursued Job,
&#8220;it looks like Mr. Jim Barney would have the
best of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221; we asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that he&#8217;s bound ter be first
ashore at Baltimore?&#8221; and the Seamew&#8217;s oldest
hand chuckled. &#8220;He&#8217;s come through on his
ship and will stand first in the old man&#8217;s estimation&mdash;no
matter how he done it. Ye know
Jothan Barney.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By crackey! will Mr. Jim beat Mr. Alfred,
then, and be boss of the firm?&#8221; Thankful Polk
demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be the end of the story, son,&#8221; said
Job, turning his cud in his cheek. &#8220;Old Jothan
sent &#8217;em out, one ter beat the other. By
jinks! one <i>has</i> beat the other. No matter how
he&#8217;s done it. It&#8217;s done, and so old Jothan will
agree, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t the firm punish Mr. Jim?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanter see the firm do anything that old
Jothan don&#8217;t want it to do,&#8221; scoffed Job.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s so, too,&#8221; agreed old Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, believing that Mr. Jim Barney deliberately
wrecked the Seamew so as to beat
his brother into Baltimore, you fellows think
his uncle will receive him with open arms?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be about it,&#8221; said Job. &#8220;Jothan
Barney is that way. He wanted one of his
nephews to show what they call &#8216;initiative&#8217;
and all that. Jim Barney&#8217;s showed it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>&#8220;And risked drowning a whole ship&#8217;s crew&mdash;two
ships&#8217; crews, in fact!&mdash;including his
brother?&#8221; I cried. &#8220;You believe he did that
just to get ahead and win his uncle&#8217;s approval?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said Job.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if he hated his brother so,&#8221; I demanded,
raising my voice in my earnestness,
&#8220;why did he risk his own life to save him?&#8221;</p>

<p>The men were silent for a moment. Then
Mr. Gates&#8217; voice came booming forward from
the quarter:</p>

<p>&#8220;You men stow your jaw-tackle. You&#8217;re
gassin&#8217; too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>That ended the discussion. But I was by
no means convinced that the seamen understood
the two Barneys. I had an entirely different
idea of how the matter would fall out in the
end.</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>In Which Is Told How the Barney Boys Go Ashore</i></p>
</div>

<p>Of course, the sinking of the Seamew would
be reported by the tug Comet, that had gone
out to meet her, and the news would be telegraphed
to Baltimore long before we reached
the port. The owners would know all about
the trouble, and I reckon Captain Joe Bowditch
had pretty serious thoughts that night as
we were towed up the bay.</p>

<p>It was a lovely evening and Phillis came out
on deck and begged me to sit with her. She
had not been so greatly frightened when the
two ships collided, because I had been right
with her and the trouble was over so quickly.
I hated to think of what might have happened,
however, if it had been the fate of the Gullwing
to sink instead of her sister ship.</p>

<p>Since they have been carried below, unconscious,
none of we foremast hands had seen
the two Barney boys. We only knew that they
had both recovered and were none the worse
for their ducking.</p>

<p>It was now the captain&#8217;s watch, however,
and Mr. Jim Barney came up and paced the
larboard side of the deck, aft. It was not long
before I caught sight of a similar figure pacing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
the starboard side of the house, and knew that
Mr. Alf Barney had come up, too.</p>

<p>Philly and I had been whispering together
under her awning and suddenly she put her
finger on my lips to enjoin secrecy, and tripped
away to Mr. Jim Barney&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>She tucked her hand in his, I could see, and
walked beside him. I am not sure whether
she said anything to him, or not; but I know he
did not send her away from him, although he was
on duty.</p>

<p>Then, after a bit, I saw Philly go to the other
side of the deck and join Mr. Alf Barney. She
must have got acquainted with him below deck,
for he welcomed her warmly. They talked
earnestly for a few moments, and then the little
girl ran back to me.</p>

<p>I had been gazing idly off over the rail, watching
the lights ashore, and thinking of my home-coming.
In this land-locked bay I could be
pretty safe in believing that I would soon be
with my mother.</p>

<p>Of course, through the machinations of my
cousin I had been kept from coming directly
home when I was at Punta Arenas. But Paul
Downes would not be in Baltimore when we
landed, to trouble me in the least. Once I got
ashore with Phillis and Thank, I was determined
to hike for Darringford House in short order.</p>

<p>I had enough money to pay two railroad fares
home&mdash;the little girl&#8217;s and my own. Thank and
I were to receive no wages for our work aboard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
the Gullwing. But I would leave Thank enough
money to keep him until I could telegraph him
more from Darringford.</p>

<p>He proposed to go home himself for a time&mdash;back
to Georgia. He had a half sister there
that he wanted to see. Then he was to join
me for the balance of the summer on the Massachusetts
coast. We had already planned
great fun at Bolderhead, despite the fact that
my bonnie sloop, the Wavecrest, was far,
far away&mdash;at Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>The matter of Dao Singh was not so easily
adjusted. I knew very well that Captain
Bowditch would insist upon reporting the case
of Phillis to the proper authorities at Baltimore.
That would include the examination
of the Hindoo on the details of the wreck of the
Galland. And just as sure as they got the
man into court I knew he would convict himself.</p>

<p>I was not willing to see the examination
dragged on for weeks, perhaps months. And
the end was not sure, either. I did not want
Dao Singh punished; and I knew that it would
trouble Philly greatly if the man was not at
her beck and call most of the time.</p>

<p>However, if Dao Singh, as a pertinent witness
in the case, was not to be found, I believed
I could get any fair-minded court to place
Phillis in the care of my mother until the
matter was concluded. That was the scheme
I had in mind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>Therefore, when we landed I proposed that
Dao Singh should disappear. I had already
sounded him. I had no money to spare, but
he seemed to have worn a belt about his waist
under his clothing, in which he told me he
carried valuables. Money I supposed.</p>

<p>Nor was he ignorant of the port to which we
were bound. He had studied the geography
of the world and he had corresponded in some
way with members of his own race located
in Baltimore.</p>

<p>&#8220;To them will I go, Webb Sahib, directly
the ship docks. If there is hue and cry, they
will not find me. When your augustness and
the Memsahib en train for your home, I shall
en train likewise. I shall not be far from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will not know when we go,&#8221; I
cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let not the Sahib fear for that. Dao
Singh will have means of knowing. Your
movements, Webb Sahib, will be learned, although
I be afar. Fear not.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this is all he would tell me. Rather a
rare bird, was Singh. He treated me always
with immense deference, waited on me when
I would let him, hand and foot, yet always
retained an air of being upon a mental or
spiritual plane immensely removed from my
own. And I&#8217;m not at all sure that he was
not possessed of intelligence far above the
order of the European or American.</p>

<p>But I have got away from my text. Philly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
and I were sitting watching the lights on shore.
As we were under towage, the watch on deck
had little to do. Therefore the captain did
not mind being aft with the little lass.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw the two Barney boys cross
the deck and stand together under the break
of the quarter. It was dark there and I could
not see how they looked at each other, nor
could I hear what they said. But they stood
there for some minutes and, when they separated,
and Mr. Jim went back to his duty, I
hoped that they had not parted in anger.</p>

<p>It seemed a dreadful thing if either, or both,
of the twins should be accused of losing one
ship and all but wrecking the other. As young
merchant officers, just starting out in life, the
affair would about ruin them. And if old
Jothan Barney stuck to his word and took
Jim Barney into the firm, and gave him all his
money, what would become of Mr. Alfred?</p>

<p>At midnight I turned in; Philly had sought
her cabin long before. She wished to be up
bright and early to see the Gullwing docked.
But I could not sleep for mulling over the case
of the Barney boys in my mind.</p>

<p>My watch was called at eight bells to wash
down and make the deck as tidy as possible
for the docking, although we were not yet
far north of the mouth of the York river. The
best we could do, however, our beautiful Gullwing
looked like a drunken old harridan that
had been out all night!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>The day was beautiful. As the shores and
islands were more clearly revealed, Philly&#8217;s
delight knew no bounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the land! the beautiful land!&#8221; she
sighed. &#8220;I want to jump for joy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got enough of the sea for all
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think I am afraid of the sea&mdash;not
as afraid as I was once,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;But
think how good it will be to step ashore! I
really don&#8217;t feel, Clint, as though I would care
to sail again right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>And despite the sorry story we had to tell
of the Seamew, there was a briskness in everybody&#8217;s
movements that told of shore leave,
and most of the men&#8217;s faces were agrin. Those
forward were making up parties for certain
pleasures and entertainments which had been
denied them for so many months.</p>

<p>Old Stronson was going immediately to the
Bethel, there to pay Captain Sowle the dollar
he had owed the good superintendent for five
years and more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do that chob at vonce,&#8221; said the old man,
&#8220;pefore somet&#8217;ings happen to me. Meppe
Captain Sowle vill take my moneys for me
and find me a goot berth aboard some gentleman&#8217;s
yacht. Das berth I like, I t&#8217;ank.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew he wanted to get away from the drink
and I hoped with all my heart that the old
man would be able to do so.</p>

<p>Tom Thornton had a married sister in Baltimore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
over to whom the bulk of his paycheck
was always paid by Barney, Blakesley &amp; Knight.
He would be put up by her, and cared for, and
kept straight as long as possible; then the old
man would go to sea again&mdash;in the Gullwing
if possible.</p>

<p>As for Bob Promise and some other of the
younger men, they were all for &#8220;the sporting
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to tog meself up in decent clothes,&#8221;
said Bob. &#8220;No slops or sheeny hand-me-downs
for me. You watch my smoke, boy,
when I get ashore. I ain&#8217;t sure that I won&#8217;t
go up to some swell hotel and stay for a week.
I reckon my bunch of coin will stand for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Never a word about salting some of the money
away for some worthy object. Jack Tar of the
merchant marine has only two states of existence&mdash;slavery
aboard ship and license ashore.
There seems to be no happy medium for him.</p>

<p>The Sea Horse towed us into our berth.
The hawsers went ashore and we were warped
in beside the dock amid a deal of clatter and
confusion.</p>

<p>There was a crowd to receive us. Some of
these people were newspaper men. The story
of the wreck of the Seamew had appeared in
the Baltimore morning papers and reporters
for the afternoon sheets were here for the particulars
at first hand. Nobody was allowed
aboard, however, although the quarantine officers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
had given us a clean bill of health down
the bay.</p>

<p>I saw standing upon the dock a tall, withered
old man, with a very sharp face and white hair
and mustache. He looked like a hawk, and
was dressed all in shabby black. Without
asking, I knew this to be old Jothan Barney,
the head of the firm that owned the Gullwing.</p>

<p>I did not see either of his nephews greet him
from the ship. Mr. Jim had plenty to do while
the ship docked, and Mr. Alf was not far from
his brother at any time. Indeed, I was not
the only person who noticed that the Barney
boys stuck together.</p>

<p>A section of the rail had been removed amidships.
A narrow gangway was run out from
the dock, the ropes were caught by two of the
seamen, and the plank made fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;First ashore!&#8221; sang out the old man and
looked from our Mr. Barney to his brother.</p>

<p>We all fell back for a moment. It was evident
that the Barneys would go ashore even
before Cap&#8217;n Joe. They approached the plank
and both smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Alf?&#8221; I heard Mr. Jim say.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you, Jim,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>And with their arms locked, the twin brothers
walked ashore together and went straight to
stand before old Jothan Barney!</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>In Which I Receive a Telegram That Troubles Me</i></p>
</div>

<p>For a moment there was a dead silence among
the crews of the sister ships. Then Captain
Bowditch himself took off his hat and started
the cheering.</p>

<p>And how he did yell! If both vessels had come
home safely we could not have given tongue
more joyfully. For in that moment every
man of us knew that whatever friction there
had been betwixt Jim and Alf Barney, they
were once more brothers and friends!</p>

<p>Of course, the crowd ashore thought we were
just glad to get home again&mdash;that we were
expressing our satisfaction upon getting to
Baltimore, safe and sound. But the Barneys
knew what it meant and both of them waved
their hands in response to our hearty hurrah.</p>

<p>As the newspaper reporters crowded aboard
to interview Captain Bowditch I saw that the
three Barneys walked away. The old man did
not even speak to the skipper of the Gullwing.
I reckoned any comment upon the skipper&#8217;s
actions by the members of the firm of Barney,
Blakesley &amp; Knight would be postponed until
some later time.</p>

<p>The newspaper fellows were eager for a story;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
but Mr. Gates and Mr. Hollister &#8220;shooed&#8221;
them away from the foremast hands. The men
would not be discharged until the next day,
when they would be taken to the offices of the
firm for a settlement of their accounts, and to
receive their discharges. Until that time they
must remain aboard and continue under the
discipline of the officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you writer chaps,&#8221; said Mr. Gates, with
a grin, &#8220;want to get these old hardshells to
spinning yarns, you&#8217;ll have to wait till they
lay their course for Front Street. You&#8217;ll have
to be contented with facts from Captain Bowditch
just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the stories of the Seamew&#8217;s tragedy were
not very ornate in the afternoon papers after
all; and public interest in the affair was soon
quenched.</p>

<p>When my watch was piped to dinner the
doctor gave me the tip to wait on deck and in
a few minutes Mr. Gates beckoned me to the
afterhouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quarterdeck etiquette is busted all to flinders,
Clint,&#8221; he said, in an unusually jolly tone,
for he was naturally a grave man. But the fact
that we were in the home port after so many
months was bound to thaw the iciest manner.
&#8220;You&#8217;re to dine with the old man and Miss
Philly.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a shame the way I looked! My second
suit of slops from the chest were pretty well
worn out and my head was a regular mop. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
had reckoned on seeing a barber about the first
thing I did when I went ashore; and I hoped
to squeeze out money enough for a cheap suit,
too, in which I might make a more presentable
appearance going home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind your clothing, Clinton,&#8221; said
Captain Bowditch, when I made some remark
of this kind. &#8220;We&#8217;ll excuse your looks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m not much better off than you,&#8221;
laughed Philly. &#8220;I have to go to bed when
Singh washes this dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, where <i>is</i> Singh?&#8221; demanded
the captain. &#8220;After dinner I want we should
all go up to the British consul&mdash;and I want
Singh to go to.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dao Singh was not to be found. I said
nothing about my talk with the Hindoo. I
knew that nobody had seen him after we got
into our berth. He might, even, have gone
ashore ahead of the Barneys. However, gone
he was and the captain was quite put out.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble with these natives,&#8221;
he growled. &#8220;Can&#8217;t trust &#8217;em. I&#8217;d ought
to put him in irons&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for, Captain? What has poor Singh
done?&#8221; asked Philly.</p>

<p>And then the captain took a tumble to himself.
The little girl knew nothing about the
man murdered in the boat from the wreck of
the Galland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a serious thing&mdash;for me&mdash;to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
let him get away without his going before the
authorities,&#8221; Captain Bowditch growled.</p>

<p>That was not exactly true however. Nobody
would blame him because the Hindoo had departed.
But the old man said he would take
us both up town right after dinner. I begged
for a little time to make myself presentable
and was given an hour&#8217;s leave ashore. I found
a barber and got my hair trimmed properly and
then went to a second hand shop and got an
outfit of coat, pants and shoes, with a new hat
for six dollars. Nothing very fashionable, you
may be sure; but I reckoned the butler would
let me into the house with &#8217;em on&mdash;by the side
door, at least!</p>

<p>So the captain and Philly and I walked over
to the British consulate and saw a young man
with eyeglasses and something of a lisp, dressed
in clothes that could not possibly be made so
badly anywhere else but in London. He was
a nice young man, though; and he insisted upon
making tea for Philly when he heard that she
had been two weeks in an open boat, as
though she might still need a &#8220;pick-me-up&#8221;
because of that adventure.</p>

<p>It seemed that he had already heard of the
loss of the Galland. Her burned hull had been
sighted by two steamships and reported before
the Gullwing arrived in port. But none of
the crew or passengers of the ill-fated ship,
until Phillis Duane came, had been reported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
as saved. The Galland had been posted as a
complete loss, with crew and passengers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What puzzles me,&#8221; said the English official,
&#8220;is the distance the Galland and the boat you
found drifted apart. Her bulk was reported
as sighted only a day or two after your Gullwing
picked up the little girl and the Hindoo.&#8221;
The captain had already explained about Dao
Singh. &#8220;Yet,&#8221; continued the consul, &#8220;the Galland
had drifted far up the coast in the steamship
route&mdash;she&#8217;s a dangerous derelict, and
has been so reported to the Hydrographic office
at Washington, and to Lloyds in London.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whereas, Captain, the latitude and longitude
you give is far, far to the south. South
of the Straits, in fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three hunder&#8217; mile sou&#8217;east of the Capes
of the Virgin, sure enough,&#8221; admitted Captain
Bowditch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. The Galland had come through the
Straits and must have met with her accident
not far outside. It seems strange that only
one boat got away from her&mdash;and that one
improperly manned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As near as we can find out, sir,&#8221; said the
skipper, &#8220;she had but two seamen in her beside
the Hindoo and the little girl here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had taken the captain and I into his private
office while he examined us regarding the
particulars of the affair. I told him frankly
about the dead man in the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must find this Dao Singh,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
I get him I cannot call the case closed, of
course. And then, there&#8217;s the little girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Bowditch spoke up for me, then.
He had had a good report of me from Captain
Hiram Rogers of the Scarboro, and he believed
what I had told him about my folks. He
would go bail for my appearance, and the production
of Philly safe and sound, whenever we
should be wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;A very good arrangement,&#8221; agreed the
consul, seemingly mightily relieved regarding
the girl. He was a bachelor himself. &#8220;Meanwhile
I will do my best to locate her people.
Of course, she must have been consigned to
somebody in England, even if she does not
know who. It seems to me as though the name
of Captain Erskin Duane is not unfamiliar to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So we got away from there after a while.
When I had gone ashore to get my fancy rigout
I had sent a telegram to Ham Mayberry.
I did that so as not to startle my mother, believing
that Ham would know how to break the
news of my arrival to her better than anybody
else. Ham had been with us so many years
that he was like one of the family.</p>

<p>And having telegraphed him I was mighty
anxious for a reply that all was well.</p>

<p>Captain Bowditch left us to report at the
offices of the ship owners and Philly and I went
back to the Gullwing where Ham was to send
his message. It had arrived while we were at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
the consul&#8217;s and Mr. Gates handed the envelope
to me the moment I came aboard.</p>

<p>With some perturbation, I broke the seal, and
to say the least I was amazed when I read
Hamilton Mayberry&#8217;s telegram:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will meet every train. Speak to nobody
until you see me.&mdash;H. M.&#8221;</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>In Which My Homecoming Proves To Be a Strange
One Indeed</i></p>
</div>

<p>Naturally I thought that Ham&#8217;s telegram
spelled trouble; but I kept my thoughts to
myself. I did not feel like discussing the
matter even with Thankful Polk.</p>

<p>We had begun to break out the Gullwing&#8217;s
cargo and worked until dark. The next day
the roustabouts would come aboard and relieve
us of that. All hands (save Thank and I)
would go up to the office to be paid off.</p>

<p>We in the forecastle heard nothing about
the Barneys that day, nor did Mr. Jim return
to the ship. We spent the evening skylarking
on the forward deck. A man had come aboard
with an accordion and the men danced, and
sang, and had a general rough-and-tumble
jollification. But I only looked on. Tomorrow
would close such scenes for me&mdash;perhaps forever.</p>

<p>In the morning a lawyer and his clerk came
aboard to take testimony regarding the loss
of the Seamew. Just as I had supposed, the
men who talked most were the old fellows who
believed that the two ships had come together
because of some supernatural attraction. The
real incidents of the collision were buried under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
a heap of rubbish, testimony that would help
the courts and the insurance people mighty
little in getting at the facts of the case.</p>

<p>I was thankful that the lawyer did not put
many questions to me. I stuck to my belief
that Mr. Jim Barney had obeyed Captain
Bowditch&#8217;s order to change the course of the
Gullwing as soon as the order was given.</p>

<p>When the examination was over there was
a deal of bustle in preparation of all hands
going ashore. I paid Job Perkins the ten
dollars I had promised him and lent Thank all
I could spare after saving out enough for the
tickets for Philly and myself to Darringford.</p>

<p>I suppose I might have borrowed a little
money from Captain Bowditch; but Thank
could get along until I could telegraph him a
hundred from home. He had agreed to accept
that much from me, and promised to join me
at my mother&#8217;s summer home later.</p>

<p>Then we bade the men good-bye, and shook
hands with the skipper and Mr. Gates and Mr.
Hollister. Thank went with Philly and me to
the railroad station. There I hoped to find
Dao Singh&mdash;and Philly was anxious about him,
too. But the Hindoo did not appear.</p>

<p>We could not wait for him; nor did I know
how to find him in Baltimore. But I told
Thank to keep a watch out for him, and if he
saw Singh to let me know at once by telegraph.</p>

<p>We took the fast express for Boston and only
had to transfer at one point. From that point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
I had engaged seats in the chair car and berths
for both Philly and myself. There was but
one day coach attached to the train when we
changed, and we were scarcely aboard when a
tall, turbanned figure appeared at the window
beside my seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Dao Singh!&#8221; cried Philly, and then
rattled away to him in his own tongue.</p>

<p>He made me a low obeisance. &#8220;I have come,
Sahib, as I promised,&#8221; he said, softly. &#8220;I
take train here with you and the Memsahib.
I ride forward in the other coach;&#8221; and bowing
he left us.</p>

<p>I saw that he had a complete new outfit&mdash;a
costume of his own country. He was a
strange looking object as he stalked away to
take his place in the day car.</p>

<p>I sent Ham another wire to say what hour
we would arrive at Darringford station. I
was sincerely worried about my mother. Perhaps
she was ill. Perhaps&mdash;I dared not ruminate
farther on that subject.</p>

<p>Phillis was greatly interested in the country
through which the train flew. We looked
pretty shabby&mdash;both of us&mdash;to be riding in a
first-class coach, and the other passengers were
curious about us. But we made no acquaintances
on the way.</p>

<p>We arrived safely in Boston in the morning,
and crossed the city to the other station. We
had not long to wait for a local train that
stopped at Darringford. It was not long after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
nine o&#8217;clock when the train stopped and we
disembarked.</p>

<p>I saw Ham instantly; but he did not have
our carriage. There was nobody else to welcome
me&mdash;there was nobody about the station, indeed,
who recognized me. I had changed a good
deal during the twenty-two months I had been
away.</p>

<p>But old Ham knew me. He rushed at me
and wrung my hands and sputtered something
at first that I could not understand. At last
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;And ye couldn&#8217;t have timed it better,
Master Clint. You&#8217;re just in the nick of time.
The court sits in ha&#8217;f an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he caught sight of Phillis and Dao
Singh right behind me.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this?&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you later,&#8221; I said. &#8220;It&#8217;s too long
a story to give you now. Besides, you&#8217;ve got
to tell me things first. Isn&#8217;t the carriage here?
Can&#8217;t we all go right to Darringford House?
Haven&#8217;t you told mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t take you home, jest yet, Master
Clint,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But mother! is&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t sick, and she ain&#8217;t well. Only
poorly. Nothing to be worried about. And
now that you&#8217;re here I reckon things will be
straightened out all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chester Downes!&#8221; I ejaculated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;s cutting up didoes,&#8221; grunted
Ham.</p>

<p>&#8220;But where is Lawyer Hounsditch?&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>And then Ham <i>did</i> amaze me&mdash;and startle
me, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Mr. Hounsditch died a month ago,
Clint,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was sudden. He was
an old man, you know, and there is nobody to
take his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My guardian is dead, then!&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was co-trustee with your mother, Clint.
That&#8217;s where the trouble lies. Chester Downes
is riggin&#8217; to get appointed in his place. It
comes up before the Judge of Probate this
morning. You ain&#8217;t but jest in time.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>That</i> woke me up, now I tell you! All my
wits were working in a minute. Ham needed
to make little more talk about it for me to
fully understand what was threatening.</p>

<p>&#8220;And mother didn&#8217;t object?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what a holt Downes has over
her,&#8221; Ham said gravely. &#8220;She <i>did</i> want him
to wait until you came home. We got your
letter from Valpariso and we knew the Gullwing
was about due in Baltimore. But Chester
Downes&mdash;you know him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us take my little friend and Dao Singh
to the hotel,&#8221; I said. &#8220;They can wait for us
there. I must have a lawyer, Ham.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got you one,&#8221; said the old man, quickly.
&#8220;We&#8217;d have gone before the court if you hadn&#8217;t
come in time and tried to get a stay.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Playfair.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew him by reputation. A better man
didn&#8217;t live in Darringford, nor a better lawyer&mdash;now
that Mr. Hounsditch was dead. And it
seemed to me that I remembered something
about Colonel Playfair and my grandfather
having once been close friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got any money, Ham?&#8221; I asked
him. &#8220;For I haven&#8217;t a cent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get a carriage, then, and drive us to the
hotel first; then to Colonel Playfair&#8217;s office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir!&#8221; returned Ham and in a few
moments we were off in a station hack, Ham
on the seat with the driver.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bramble kept the Darringford
Hotel, and I left Philly in the good lady&#8217;s care.
Dao Singh remained with her, of course. Then
Ham and I raced to the office of the lawyer.</p>

<p>It was already half past nine. There was no
time to lose if the matter of an appointment of
a new trustee for the Darringford estate was
the first item on the docket.</p>

<p>I knew Colonel Playfair by sight&mdash;a soldierly,
white haired veteran with one arm. His shabby
offices were in a brick building near the courthouse.
I don&#8217;t suppose he would have known
me in my present guise had not Ham Mayberry
vouched for my identity.</p>

<p>&#8220;A close call, young man,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
understand you object to this Chester Downes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
being appointed in the place of Mr. Hounsditch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I more than object,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
have it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoighty-toighty!&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s not
the way to go into court. You have a choice,
of course; but don&#8217;t speak that way to Judge
Fetter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; I said, restraining myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you must have somebody else in mind
to suggest for the appointment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are familiar with the situation, Colonel?&#8221;
I asked. &#8220;You knew my grandfather,
and you know how he made his will?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! I know all about it,&#8221; he returned,
grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the man to take Lawyer Hounsditch&#8217;s
place. The co-trustee should be a
lawyer, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, I don&#8217;t know about this,&#8221; he
said, slowly. &#8220;You really should have another
attorney, then, to appear before Judge Fetter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jest git it put over, Colonel,&#8221; said Ham,
eagerly. &#8220;Then we kin settle about the trimmings
afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonel laughed and took up his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go across to
the judge&#8217;s chambers and see what we can do,&#8221;
and he led the way out of his office.</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>In Which Mr. Chester Downes and I Again
&#8220;Lock Horns&#8221;</i></p>
</div>

<p>This had not been the home-coming I had
looked forward to. I had not desired to take
up the old fight with my uncle, Mr. Chester
Downes. But it seemed as though circumstances
were forever opposing us in some wrangle
or other!</p>

<p>We three, with the old Colonel leading, went
quietly into the room where Judge Fetter held
his court. Nobody noticed us and Colonel
Playfair motioned Ham and I to seats well
back in the room. There were maybe a score
of people on the benches. The lawyers and
those individuals who were pertinently interested
in the matters to be arranged, were allowed
inside the rail before the Judge&#8217;s desk. Colonel
Playfair went up there and the justice
nodded to him. Nobody knew whom he represented,
or in what matter he was interested.</p>

<p>I saw Mr. Chester Downes at once; but my
uncle did not see me. He sat with his back to
me, in fact, and beside him was a slim and sleek
looking man with a green bag before him on
the table.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s Jim Maxwell,&#8221; whispered Ham.
&#8220;And he&#8217;s the kind of a lawyer that Chester
Downes would cotton to, all right. I ain&#8217;t
got no manner o&#8217; use for Jim Maxwell. He&#8217;s
one o&#8217; them landsharks, he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>The proceedings droned along for a time.
Two matters of probate were settled before our
case came up. Then his clerk handed Judge
Fetter some papers, he put on his nose glasses,
glanced at them, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;In the matter of the appointment of Mr.
Chester Downed as co-trustee with Mrs. Mary
Webb, Widow&mdash;the Darrington Estate. There
is a minor child, I believe? You speak in this
matter, Mr. Maxwell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the honor to do so,&#8221; said the sleek
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no objection to the appointment,
I understand?&#8221; pursued the Judge. &#8220;The
widow is satisfied?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much so,&#8221; declared the lawyer.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is not here present?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ill health, your honor,&#8221; said Maxwell,
briskly! &#8220;But Mr. Downes, who is her brother-in-law,
has been her man of business for years.
Mr. Hounsditch, lately deceased, although appointed
under the will, was merely a figure-head
in the affairs of the estate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this minor child&mdash;how old is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seventeen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah. He has no choice, then? He does not
object to his uncle as a trustee?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>&#8220;The boy has run away from home, your
honor. He is a little wild&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Mr.
Maxwell.</p>

<p>I was so enraged that I could not keep my
seat; but Ham pulled me back. &#8220;Take it
easy, Clint,&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; the judge mooned along,
rustling the papers, &#8220;there being no objection,
and Mr. Chester Downes&#8217; bond being entirely
satisfactory&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Playfair arose. The Judge looked
at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg pardon, Brother Playfair,&#8221; he said,
politely. &#8220;You surely do not appear in this
matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, your honor, I do,&#8221; said the Colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;You represent anybody interested?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I most certainly do,&#8221; said the Colonel. &#8220;I
represent the minor child, Clinton Webb.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Chester Downes leaned forward and
whispered to his lawyer. The latter sprang
up again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg Colonel Playfair&#8217;s pardon,&#8221; Maxwell
said. &#8220;Does he state that he has been engaged
directly by the boy mentioned to represent
him before this court?&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Playfair was silent for a moment,
and the other lawyer went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;For if not, I object. No engagement of an
attorney by outside parties will stand, your
honor. We expected some interference by officious
friends of the misguided boy. His mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
is his legal guardian, Mr. Hounsditch being
dead&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said the Judge, patiently. &#8220;Colonel
Playfair knows the law as well as any man
here,&#8221; and he smiled and bowed. &#8220;State
your position, sir,&#8221; he said to the Colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I represent the minor, your honor,&#8221; he said,
quietly. &#8220;If it becomes necessary application
will be made for the appointment of both a
guardian as well as co-trustee of the estate,
on behalf of Clinton Webb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the boy has run away! He is incorrigible,&#8221;
cried Lawyer Maxwell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother Maxwell is misinformed,&#8221; said the
Colonel, suavely, &#8220;If he does not know the
truth, his client does. Clinton Webb did not
run away from home. He was blown out to
sea in a little sloop from Bolderhead. It is a
matter of record&mdash;newspaper record, your honor.
He was picked up by a vessel bound for the
South Seas. From that distance he has only
lately been able to get a ship homeward bound.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chester Downes was whispering again to
his lawyer. The eyes of the sleek Mr. Maxwell
snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your honor!&#8221; cried he, interrupting Colonel
Playfair.</p>

<p>The colonel politely gave way to him. The
Judge looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your honor! The fact of his having left
home in the first place involuntarily is admitted.
But he has refused to return. His mother sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
money for his passage to Buenos Ayres. He
supposedly wasted the money and remained
wilfully out of her jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Playfair?&#8221; queried the Judge.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Brother Maxwell is quite finished,&#8221; said
the colonel, &#8220;I would like to state our side of
the argument.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Continue,&#8221; said the Judge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to wash dirty linen in court,&#8221;
Colonel Playfair said, quietly. &#8220;These family
troubles would better be settled outside of the
courtroom. But it seems necessary to place
the full facts before your honor. It is not only
a proven fact that Clinton Webb left home
involuntarily; but there was a crime attached
to his adventure. He was nailed into the cabin
of his boat and the boat was cut adrift at the
beginning of the September gale, two years
ago this coming fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>The spectators began to sit up and take
notice. The affair was assuming a serious hue.</p>

<p>&#8220;The person who committed this dastardly
crime is known&mdash;known to Brother Maxwell&#8217;s
client. This person, afraid of being arrested
for his deed, actually <i>did</i> run away from home,
went to Buenos Ayres, there represented himself
as Clinton Webb and obtained the money
sent there by Mrs. Webb for her son, and is
now, I understand, a member of the crew of the
whaling bark, Scarboro, in the South Pacific.</p>

<p>&#8220;These final facts are proven by a letter from
the American consul at Buenos Ayres, sent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
Mr. Hounsditch, deceased, together with the
amount of money which had been given to the
false claimant by a clerk in the consul&#8217;s office.
Does Mr. Maxwell wish me to state the name
of the person who committed these criminal
acts?&#8221;</p>

<p>My uncle&#8217;s lawyer was evidently in a fine
flurry. He jumped up to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;We let the point pass for the present. But
we claim that the minor child, Clinton Webb,
has no standing in this court. He is on the
high seas&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrong, Brother Maxwell,&#8221; said the colonel,
very sweetly. &#8220;He is here.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw Mr. Chester Downes start from his
seat. He cried out something, but the Judge
rapped his desk for order.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say your client is present in court,
Colonel?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clinton Webb! Come forward!&#8221; commanded
my lawyer, and that time Ham did
not try to keep me in my seat.</p>

<p>I marched down the aisle. Mr. Chester
Downes saw me coming. His dark face never
paled; the blood flooded into it, darkening it
until his cheeks and brow were almost black.</p>

<p>We looked at each other. There was no need
for either to threaten the other. As of old, we
were sworn enemies. And I believed that I
had again crossed him in his most precious
project.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>The colonel let me into the enclosure through
the gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;You recognize your nephew, do you, Mr.
Downes?&#8221; asked the Judge.</p>

<p>Chester Downes nodded. He could not speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I understand that Clinton Webb, here
before us, objects to the appointment of his
uncle as co-trustee of the estate?&#8221; he asked
the colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;He does,&#8221; was the brief reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your wish, then, Colonel?&#8221; asked
Judge Fetter. &#8220;This matter, evidently, is not
ready for closing to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, your honor. We ask for a postponement&mdash;that
is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you agree, Brother Maxwell?&#8221; asked
the judge.</p>

<p>Maxwell looked at his client. There was
nothing else to do but to agree and Downes
knew it as well as the lawyer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; snarled Chester Downes. &#8220;We
will have to fight, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>He and I had locked horns again; but he
would not admit then that he was worsted.</p>

<p>Colonel Playfair had a few moments&#8217; whispered
conversation with Judge Fetter, and then
we went back to the lawyer&#8217;s office. Chester
Downes and Maxwell had hastened away from
the courthouse. My uncle did not try to speak
to me&mdash;and I was glad. I am afraid I could not
have controlled myself just then.</p>

<p>There were some papers to sign and more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
discussion in Colonel Playfair&#8217;s office. He called
in a brother practitioner, Mr. Charles Ahorn,
and the matters were turned over to him.
Colonel Playfair agreed to step into poor Mr.
Hounsditch&#8217;s shoes, and be my guardian and
co-trustee with my mother, if the other side
could come to an agreement. I believed,
when I had talked with my mother, that she
would make no objection.</p>

<p>Crafty as I knew my uncle to be, I could not
believe that he had so succeeded in warping
my mother&#8217;s judgment that she would believe
everything ill he had said of me. And I counted
on her love as a surety.</p>

<p>Much as she might disregard my personal
opinion of Chester Downes, I was sure she
would welcome me with open arms!</p>

<p class="ph1"><i>In Which My Welcome Home Is a Real Welcome,
After All</i></p>
</div>

<p>Ham and I went back in the hack to the
hotel, where we had dinner with Phillis, Dao
Singh standing behind my chair, and waiting
at table. I had an idea right then and there
that James, the butler, would find his job in
danger when we got settled at Darringford
House.</p>

<p>Briefly, while we ate, I related some of my
adventures to my old friend. Particularly
those that had to do with Philly and the Hindoo.</p>

<p>&#8220;It beats all&mdash;it sure does!&#8221; Ham kept repeating,
and could scarcely keep his eyes off
the turbanned servant.</p>

<p>When we drove through the wide gateway
to the grounds surrounding Darringford House,
I saw the flutter of a light dress upon the verandah.
When we rounded the turn in the drive
and the shrubbery was past, I knew my mother
was standing there. But I certainly <i>was</i>
amazed to see Chester Downes sitting in one
of the arm chairs. No matter what happened,
he never owned up beat! I had to hand it to
him there.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>But I saw what he was up to immediately.
He had hurried ahead to break the news of
my coming to my mother, and to lay plans for
his continued influence in the house. My
mother and the estate were practically his
bread and butter. I knew that well enough.</p>

<p>But nothing then could spoil the joy of my
home-coming. I tore open the door of the
hack before it stopped and leaped out. Mother
rushed into my arms as I came up the step and
I swung her up off the ground&mdash;she was such
a little, dainty woman!&mdash;and I knew that
she had never ceased to love me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clint! Clint!&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;My dear,
dear boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hug me again, mother!&#8221; I returned, trying
to laugh, but making a poor mess of it. &#8220;This
is the happiest minute I&#8217;ve seen for two years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how you&#8217;ve grown!&#8221; she gasped,
pushing me off a bit so that she could look me
over better.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you haven&#8217;t grown a bit!&#8221; I laughed,
and swung her again until she was breathless.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I hope you have got enough of the
awful sea and sea-going!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Oh,
Clint! You will stay at home now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly hope to,&#8221; I returned, casting a
meaning glance at Chester Downes, who had
risen, with a false smile on his face, and his
hand outstretched.</p>

<p>But in spite of the fact that at that moment
I meant all that I said, and had not the remotest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
idea that I should ever go to sea again, circumstances
not then dreamed of changed my intentions
later; and the reader who so desires
may follow my further course afloat in the
fourth volume of this series, entitled: &#8220;The
Ocean Express; or, Clint Webb Aboard the
Sea Tramp.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then my mother caught sight of Philly and
Dao Singh. They had stepped out of the hack
and the tall Hindoo, in his oriental costume,
stood gravely behind the little golden haired
beauty. She looked like a story out of some
Eastern Fairy Tale, and Dao Singh just set
her off nicely.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pretty child!&#8221; mother murmured, clasping
her hands, and I know that at that instant
her heart went out to Phillis Duane.</p>

<p>Philly was looking up at her with a bashful
little smile; yet the golden lights in her brown
eyes were dancing. She had laughed to see
how I had caught my little mother up off the
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is she, Clinton?&#8221; mother asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My sister,&#8221; I told her, proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; gasped mother, and I saw Chester
Downes echo the word, but in a whisper. I
could imagine the start my announcement gave
him. And yet, my statement could not explain
all that I saw in my uncle&#8217;s face as he glared
at little Phillis. It was not until afterward,
however, that I remembered how startled
Chester Downes was.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve agreed to, mother,&#8221;
I said, smiling, too, at my pretty little friend.
&#8220;We have adopted each other. Now it remains
with you to take Phillis Duane right into your
heart along with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dear, dear child!&#8221; mother murmured,
and went down the verandah steps to meet the
girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I shall love you, dearly! dearly!&#8221;
cried Philly, and put her arms around mother&#8217;s
neck as the latter stooped over her.</p>

<p>Dao Singh made a low obeisance. Mother
looked rather startled at him and then turned
to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dao Singh,&#8221; I explained, &#8220;has had much
care of Phillis since she was little. He insists
upon attending upon her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And upon the Webb Sahib,&#8221; concluded
the Hindoo, gravely. &#8220;It is well that the little
Memsahib and Webb Sahib, come in health
to Her Ladyship, on whom be peace and health.
Dao Singh is her servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent low again, took up the hem of my
mother&#8217;s voluminous summer dress, and pressed
it to his forehead. Mother looked amazed,
and well she might&mdash;a new daughter and such
a kingly serving person thrust upon her so
unexpectedly. I had to laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Ladyship will get used to it in time.
As a man before the mast in an old windjammer,
being served by an oriental prince has its drawbacks;
but you&#8217;ll get used to it, Little Mum!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>But mother&#8217;s interest was soon fixed entirely
upon Phillis, and with her hand upon the child&#8217;s
shoulder, she urged her up the steps. There
Chester Downes was hanging about, eager to
be noticed, anxious to come into the picture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Uncle Chester, Clinton,&#8221; said mother,
&#8220;has been so kind to me while you were away.&#8221;</p>

<p>I said nothing. She glanced from my face
to his, and then back again, and her lips began
to tremble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I hoped that you would meet him differently
now, Clinton,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry if I consider Mr. Downes just
what he was before I went away. Any house
would be uncomfortable if both of us remained
in it. Can I speak plainer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to, boy!&#8221; snarled Mr.
Downes, his face reddening again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Playfair will probably see you at
any time you wish to call on him&mdash;either he or
Mr. Charles Aborn,&#8221; I said, pointedly. &#8220;They
have my affairs in charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother did not hear. She was talking with
Phillis. And Mr. Downes, after a brief hesitation,
went down the steps and through the
shrubbery to the street.</p>

<p>I took the chair upon the other side of Philly
and Dao Singh, like a gaily painted life-size
statue, stood at a respectable distance. Briefly
we told mother the story of the little girl&#8217;s
adventures; and as I well knew mother received
the waif with joy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>&#8220;It has been a great sorrow all his life, my
child,&#8221; mother said, drawing Philly upon her
lap, &#8220;that Clint had no sister. A boy is a
great comfort to a widowed woman; but he
cannot take the place of a daughter. Love
me, my child, if you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I knew by the way that the child threw
her arms about mother&#8217;s neck and sobbed upon
her breast, that she had already begun to love
my mother. Philly&#8217;s heart had been sore for
just the sort of protective care my mother could
give her. I saw that my scheme was going to
be a huge success!</p>

<p>With Chester Downes out of the way my
home-coming was all that I could have hoped
for. The help around the house welcomed
me with delight, too. Even my mother&#8217;s
French maid, Marie Portent, gave me a wintry
smile&mdash;and I had never been a favorite with
her.</p>

<p>The neighbors came in to see me, too, for
the news had spread all over town that I had
come back from my wanderings. Mr. Chester
Downes had not succeeded in turning everybody
against me.</p>

<p>But you may believe I got into some decent
clothes before I held any reception. Then I
went down town and wired Thankful Polk a
hundred dollars and the news that everything
was O. K. with me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we will go to Bolderhead and open
the house for the rest of the summer,&#8221; mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
said that very evening. &#8220;I could not bear to
open it without you, dear boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>We kept off the subject of the Downes just
then; but I might as well state right here that
Mr. Chester Downes was not appointed by
the court co-trustee with my mother. Colonel
Playfair <i>was</i>, and that before we closed Darringford
house and went to live in mother&#8217;s
summer villa on Bolderhead Neck.</p>

<p>Thankful Polk came north to visit us, too;
and mother was greatly pleased with him.
Dao Singh, as I foresaw, soon made it advisable
for us to find another situation for James, our
butler. Singh actually, when we got to Bolderhead,
took the entire responsibility of the
housekeeping upon himself, and mother thankfully
declared that she had never had so easy
a time before, nor had the household been run
so smoothly.</p>

<p>For the first time since I could remember
Mr. Chester Downes did not go to Bolderhead
with us. I had no friction over it, and mother
was not troubled. Colonel Playfair knew how
to bring things about. I liked him a whole
lot better for a guardian than I had Mr. Hounsditch.</p>

<p>As for my cousin Paul, when he returned
home&mdash;if he ever did&mdash;I knew I had a method of
keeping him at a distance. The threat of
punishment for what he had done to me still
hung over him like a sword of Damocles.</p>

<p>It was not many weeks before I had a letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
from Mr. Jim Barney. Among other interesting
items of news, he stated that both he and his
brother had been exonerated together with
Captain Bowditch in the matter of the collision
and the sinking of the Seamew. If blame lay
anywhere it was upon poor Captain Somes, who
had gone down with his ship.</p>

<p>As to the Barney brothers&#8217; private affairs,
they had both refused their uncle&#8217;s offer of
money and position. As long as the old man
would not divide his wealth between them and
give both of them an opportunity of entering
the shipping firm, Jim and Alf had resigned
and were going to sail upon ships belonging to
other owners. That seemed to them to be the
best and final settlement of the matter.</p>

<p>I often thought of my long cruise in the Windjammer,
and I could not say that I was sorry
for having gone through those adventures.
I certainly was not sorry that they had brought
about the coming of Phillis Duane to our
house. For, as the weeks flew by, the British
consul heard nothing regarding the girl&#8217;s friends
or relatives.</p>

<p>It looked as though she was ours &#8220;for keeps,&#8221;
as Thank said; and both my mother and I were
satisfied.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
